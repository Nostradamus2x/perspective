OpIndia,23/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/around-51-lakh-voters-to-be-removed-from-bihar-voter-list-as-eci-finds-major-discrepancies/,"Around 51 lakh voters to be removed from Bihar voter list as ECI finds major discrepancies in SIR exercise due to duplicate entries, death...","The Election Commission of India (ECI) has found major differences in the voter roll of Bihar through a special verification campaign referred to as the Special Intensive Revision (SIR). The ECI reported that approximately 18 lakh enrolled voters have died, 26 lakh have shifted, and 7 lakh names are duplicates.

The ECI revealed that nearly 97.30% of Bihar’s total 7.89 crore voters have completed the enumeration forms till now. That is more than 7.68 crore voters have already replied.

Officers such as the Chief Electoral Officer (CEO), District Election Officers (DEOs), Electoral Registration Officers (EROs), and Booth Level Officers (BLOs) are coordinating with political party workers to sanitize the voters’ list. The ECI has also published a list of 21.36 lakh voters whose forms are yet to be submitted, and approximately 52.30 lakh names of individuals who are deceased, have migrated permanently, or are listed in more than one location.

The ECI further stated that the BLOs and EROs are providing detailed lists of such voters to all political parties so that the process remains transparent. The people will be allowed a complete one-month period in order to object to or make corrections on names being added or removed from the voter list.

Opposition raises concerns

But the Opposition is strongly criticising this exercise. Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has charged the NDA alliance with attempting to delete names of people from the voter roll. She complained that voter rolls were inflated in Maharashtra elections, and now, voters are being deleted in Bihar in the guise of revision.

She stated, “Earlier, in Maharashtra, votes were tampered with by padding electoral rolls. Now, in Bihar, efforts are being made to do the same by deleting voters’ names. The ‘vote ban’ under the pretext of SIR is a plot to grab the right to vote given by the Constitution. We oppose every attempt to crush the Constitution.”

SIR exercise in Bihar

The Special Intensive Revision (SIR) is being conducted in Bihar to revise the voters’ lists for the upcoming assembly elections in the state. This kind of intensive revision occurred in the state for the last time in 2003. Due to changes such as urban migration, fatalities, new young voters, and the problem of illegal immigrants, a new verification became necessary.

BLOs have been designated to go to houses and ensure the rolls are correct. The objective is straightforward: to register all legitimate voters, eliminate illegitimate ones, and maintain transparency in the procedure.

The elections for the Bihar Assembly are scheduled later in the year sometime around October or November, but the official release date has not been declared yet.

OpIndia,23/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/1-29-lakh-bigha-land-occupied-by-bangladeshi-infiltrators-and-doubtful-citizens-freed-in-4-years-informs-assam-cm-himanta-biswa-sarma/,"1.29 lakh bigha land occupied by Bangladeshi infiltrators and doubtful citizens freed in 4 years, informs Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma","Chief Minister of Assam, Himanta Biswa Sarma stated that around 29 lakh bighas (nearly 10 lakh acres) of land in Assam is reported to be occupied by “Bangladeshi infiltrators and doubtful citizens.” He mentioned that after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government took office in 2021, a campaign was initiated to reclaim the property but they encountered international pressure to cease these actions.

He made the shocking disclosures on 21st July during a function commemorating the fourth anniversary of the Multipurpose Agricultural Project at Garukhuti in the Darang district.

This project commenced in 2021, and to date, 77,420 bighas of land (25,500 acres) have been cleared of encroachments.

“Today, the land in Garukhuti, once occupied illegally, has been converted into productive agricultural fields. This is the model we aim to replicate across encroached areas in Assam,” he conveyed.

In the last 4 years, we have freed over 42,000 acres of land from encroachers and dedicated it to public use. pic.twitter.com/AaWDKMcNTK — Himanta Biswa Sarma (@himantabiswa) July 21, 2025

According to media reports, Sarma remarked, “After the successful execution of the campaign in the Darang district, the initiative was also extended to Borsola, Lumding, Burhapahar, Pabha, Batadrava, Chapar and Paikan. In the last four years, we have reclaimed 1.29 lakh bigha (around 43,000 acres) of occupied land. A considerable portion of it is now being allocated for forest development and the citizens of the state.”

He declared, “If anyone believes that after two or three campaigns we will be intimidated, not confront them directly and bow down, they are mistaken. The martyrs of the Assam Movement will certainly be avenged.” He mentioned that during the Assam Movement from 1983 to 1985, there was a prevailing sense of defeat and many individuals had “surrendered” to the Congress which changed the political trajectory of the state.

Shankar-Madhav became Shankar-Azan

Sarma pointed out that, at a certain point, we started referring to Shankar-Madhav as Shankar-Azan. Azan Peer will continue to maintain his pivotal role, yet Madhav (Madhavdev) also has his own significant position. It is only then that our “caste” can be preserved. Srimanta Sankardev and Sri Sri Madhavdev are esteemed Vaishnav saints in Assam whereas Azan Peer was a Muslim sage who arrived there from Iraq during the 17th century.

Over 1000 bighas of land cleared in Goalpara

The Himanta government is actively involved in measures to safeguard the state’s demographic composition. As part of the drive, encroached lands have been reclaimed in various locations. On 12th July, an eviction operation took place in the Paikan Reserve Forest located in the Goalpara district. 140 hectares (equivalent to 1038 to 1040 bighas) of forest land had been unlawfully taken over predominantly by Muslims.

Tejas Mariswamy, the Divisional Forest Officer of Goalpara outlined that 1,080 families had built houses in this area. The majority of these individuals were Muslims who had migrated from adjacent regions or Bangladesh. A total of 36 bulldozers were utilized during the action and the region was divided into 6 distinct blocks. Nearly 2,500 to 2,700 structures, including houses and shops were dismantled. Over 1,000 police officers and forest guards were deployed for security purposes.

Mamata Banerjee cries “atrocities on Bengalis”

A war of words broke out on social media between Sarma and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee over the removal of infiltrators and illegal occupation in Assam. She complained that the administration is persecuting the Bengali community in Assam by singling them out, labeling it as the BJP’s divisive agenda.

However, Sarma responded that it is not the Bengalis but rather Muslim infiltrators who are being expelled from Assam. He also referenced a statement from the Supreme Court which characterized infiltration as an external invasion.",chief minister assam himanta biswa sarma stated around 29 lakh bighas nearly 10 lakh acre land assam reported occupied “bangladeshi infiltrator doubtful citizen ” mentioned bharatiya janata party bjp government took office 2021 campaign initiated reclaim property encountered international pressure cease action made shocking disclosure 21st july function commemorating fourth anniversary multipurpose agricultural project garukhuti darang district project commenced 2021 date 77 420 bighas land 25 500 acre cleared encroachment “today land garukhuti occupied illegally converted productive agricultural field model aim replicate across encroached area assam ” conveyed last 4 year freed 42 000 acre land encroacher dedicated public use pic twitter com aawdkmcntk — himanta biswa sarma himantabiswa july 21 2025 according medium report sarma remarked “after successful execution campaign darang district initiative also extended borsola lumding burhapahar pabha batadrava chapar paikan last four year reclaimed 1 29 lakh bigha around 43 000 acre occupied land considerable portion allocated forest development citizen state ” declared “if anyone belief two three campaign intimidated confront directly bow mistaken martyr assam movement certainly avenged ” mentioned assam movement 1983 1985 prevailing sense defeat many individual “surrendered” congress changed political trajectory state shankar madhav became shankar azan sarma pointed certain point started referring shankar madhav shankar azan azan peer continue maintain pivotal role yet madhav madhavdev also significant position “caste” preserved srimanta sankardev sri sri madhavdev esteemed vaishnav saint assam whereas azan peer muslim sage arrived iraq 17th century 1000 bighas land cleared goalpara himanta government actively involved measure safeguard state’s demographic composition part drive encroached land reclaimed various location 12th july eviction operation took place paikan reserve forest located goalpara district 140 hectare equivalent 1038 1040 bighas forest land unlawfully taken predominantly muslim tejas mariswamy divisional forest officer goalpara outlined 1 080 family built house area majority individual muslim migrated adjacent region bangladesh total 36 bulldozer utilized action region divided 6 distinct block nearly 2 500 2 700 structure including house shop dismantled 1 000 police officer forest guard deployed security purpose mamata banerjee cry “atrocities bengalis” war word broke social medium sarma west bengal chief minister mamata banerjee removal infiltrator illegal occupation assam complained administration persecuting bengali community assam singling labeling bjp’s divisive agenda however sarma responded bengali rather muslim infiltrator expelled assam also referenced statement supreme court characterized infiltration external invasion

The resignation came on the opening day of the Monsoon Session of Parliament, catching many by surprise amid a busy legislative agenda. Speculations are rife about the timing of Dhankhar’s resignation, with the opposition claiming that the reasons behind his stepping down may be far deeper than just health reasons.

In his letter to President Droupadi Murmu, Jagdeep Dhankhar invoked Article 67(a) of the Constitution to make his resignation effective immediately. Citing ongoing health challenges, he stated his intention to “prioritise health care and abide by medical advice.”

From the very onset in 2022, Dhankhar’s tenure as Vice President was marked by his vocal criticism of the judiciary, especially on the issues of its overreach and accountability. Being a seasoned lawyer himself and having a background in the Supreme Court and the Rajasthan High Court, Jagdeep Dhankhar consistently raised concerns over the alleged encroachment of the powers of the legislature and executive by the judiciary, arguing that their actions undermined the supremacy of Parliament and the balance of powers as prescribed in the Constitution.

“Judiciary cannot become executive”: When Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar warned the judiciary that its overreach might destabilise governance

Hitting back at the judiciary regarding the overturning of parliamentary amendments to the Constitution in December 2022, VP Jagdeep Dhankhar warned that the judiciary cannot become the legislative or the executive because doing so may destabilise the system of government as a whole.

Dhankhar stated during the eighth LM Singhvi memorial lecture that our judiciary, as one of the important institutions of government, cannot be the executive or legislative.

“The doctrine of separation of power is fundamental to our governance. Any incursion, howsoever subtle, in the domain of the other by one has the capacity or potential to unsettle the apple cart of governance,” then vice president stated.

“India in 2015-16 was dealing with a constitutional amendment act and as a matter of record the entire Lok Sabha voted unanimously and there was no abstention in Lok Sabha and that amendment act was passed. In Rajya Sabha, there was no opposition. We the people their ordainment came to be reflected through the most sanctified mechanisms through the applicable mechanisms. That power was undone. The world does not know of any such instance. I appeal to all judicial minds please think of a parallel in the world where a constitutional provision can be undone,” the vice president stated.

In the presence of then Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud, several Supreme Court judges, Union Ministers, then Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and several lawyers, Dhankhar further said, “Power resides in ‘We the People’ – their mandate, their wisdom… If a constitutional provision that carries the ordainment of the people at large in such a vibrant democracy is undone, what will happen? I appeal to the people here, they constitute a judicial elite class, thinking minds, intellectuals – please find out a parallel in the world where a constitutional provision can be undone.”

He also asserted that while the Indian Constitution clearly states in Article 145(3) that the court may interpret the Constitution where a serious question of law is involved. “Nowhere it say a provision can be run down.”

When VP Jagdeep Dhankhar came down heavily on the Supreme Court for scrapping the NJAC

Back in December 2022, Dhankhar criticised the Supreme Court over the 99th Constitutional Amendment Bill paving way for the National Judicial Appointment Commission (NJAC), which was undone by the Supreme Court in 2015.

“The Parliament in a much-needed historic step passed the 99th Constitutional Amendment Bill, paving the way for the National Judicial Appointment Commission (NJAC). There was unprecedented support for the above. On August 13, 2014, the Lok Sabha unanimously voted in its favour with there being no abstentions. This House too, passed it unanimously on August 14, 2014, with one abstention. Rarely in Parliamentary democracy, there has been such massive support to a Constitutional legislation,” Dhankhar said.

“This process fructified into a Constitutional prescription, after 16 State Assemblies out of 29 States ratified the Central Legislation; the President of India, in terms of Article 111, accorded his consent on December 31, 2014,” he added.

Furthermore, then Vice President, Jagdeep Dhankhar stated that this was the first time that a duly legitimised constitutional prescription was judicially undone, “This historic parliamentary mandate was undone by the Supreme Court on October 16, 2015 by a majority of 4:1 finding the same as not being in consonance with the judicially evolved doctrine of ‘Basic Structure’ of the Constitution,” said.

Dhankhar had called the scrapping of the NJAC a severe compromise of parliamentary sovereignty and disregard of the mandate of the people, of which this house and the Lok Sabha are custodians.

VP Dhankhar had also emphasised that Parliament is the exclusive and ultimate determinative of the architecture of the Constitution.

“We need to bear in mind that in democratic governance, the basis of any ‘Basic Structure’ is the prevalence of primacy of the mandate of the people reflected in the Parliament. Parliament is the exclusive and ultimate determinative of the architecture of the Constitution,” said.

It must be recalled that back in 2014, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government brought the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) Act in an attempt to change the system of appointment of judges. The NJAC was a proposed body, which would have been responsible for the appointment and transfer of judges to the higher judiciary. The NJAC Act and the Constitutional Amendment Act came into force on April 13, 2015. But the top court on October 16, 2015, struck down the NJAC Act. The verdict brought back the primacy of the collegium system of judges appointing judges.

VP Jagdeep Dhankhar differed from Supreme Court’s idea of ‘basic structure’ doctrine

In January 2023, Dhankhar once again reignited the discussion over the doctrine of the separation of powers. This time, he cited the Supreme Court’s landmark judgment in the 1973 Kesavanand Bharati case wherein the court had ruled that while Parliament had the authority to amend the Constitution, it cannot amend its basic structure.

Delivering his inaugural address at the 83rd All-India Presiding Officers Conference in Jaipur, Jagdeep Dhankhar questioned: “Are we a democratic nation?”

Asserting that all three pillars of democracy: legislature, executive and judiciary must function within their limits, then Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar said, “In a democratic society, the basis of any basic structure is supremacy of the people, sovereignty of the people, sovereignty of Parliament. Executive thrives on the sovereignty of Parliament. Legislatures and Parliament decide who will be the Chief Minister, who will be the Prime Minister. The ultimate power is with the Legislature. The Legislature decides who will be in other institutions. In such a situation, all Constitutional institutions – the Legislative, Executive, Judiciary – are required to be within their limits.”

Expressing his disagreement over the Supreme Court ruling in the Kesavanand Bharati case that the Parliament cannot amend the constitution’s basic structure, Dhankhar said, “In 1973, in the Kesavananda Bharati case, the Supreme Court gave the idea of basic structure, saying that Parliament can amend the Constitution, but not its basic structure. With due respect to the Judiciary, I cannot subscribe to this.”

‘Time has come to revisit’: When Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar questioned the involvement of the CJI in executive appointments

In February 2025, Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar questioned how the judiciary can be involved in executive appointments as the Supreme Court of India was hearing a petition seeking to include the Chief Justice of India in the selection committee for the Election Commission. He said while earlier the executive yielded to the inclusion of judges in executive functions, it was time to revisit the norms.

Speaking at the National Judicial Academy, Bhopal, Dhankhar said that such a system should not exist in a democracy like India. He wondered how the Chief Justice of India participates in the selection of the CBI director, even by “statutory prescription”.

The vice president said, “To stir your minds, how can in a country like ours or in any democracy, by statutory prescription, the Chief Justice of India participate in the selection of the CBI director! Can there be any legal rationale for it? I can appreciate that the statutory prescription took shape because the Executive of the day has yielded to a judicial verdict. But time has come to revisit.”

Jagdeep Dhankhar further said, “This surely does not merge with democracy. How can we involve the Chief Justice of India in any executive appointment?”

Dhankhar went on to say that while the Supreme Court has the power to interpret the constitution, there can be no “arrogation of authority” under the guise of interpretation. The essence and spirit which the founding fathers had in mind under Article 145(3) must be respected.”

He further advocated for an increase in the constitutional bench strength, as originally the constitution bench comprised the majority of total judges.

“When the strength of the Supreme Court was eight judges, under Article 145(3), there was a stipulation that interpretation of the Constitution would be by a bench of five judges or more. Please note, when this strength was eight, it was five. And the Constitution allows the highest court of the land to interpret the Constitution. If I analyse arithmetically, they were very sure the interpretation will be by the majority of judges, because the strength then was eight. That five stands as it is. And the number (of total judges) is more than fourfold,” he said.

VP Dhankhar’s advocacy for including domain experts in arbitral process instead of retired judges

In March 2025, Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar said that the arbitral process in India is “just an additional burden to the normal hierarchical mechanism of adjudication.”

Addressing the Colloquium organised by the India International Arbitration Centre (IIAC) at Bharat Mandapam, Dhankhar said, “Arbitrators play as much critical role as members of the bar associated with the arbiter process. Surprisingly, there is, I’m saying it with utmost restraint, absolute tight-fist control of a segment of a category that is involved with arbiter process determination. This tight-fist control emanates out of judicial feats. And if we examine it on an objective platform, it is excruciatingly painful.”

Emphasising the significance of Article 136 and its effects on the arbitration process, Dhankhar said that while Article 136 was supposed to be a narrow slit, it is hurting the arbitral process.

“The Attorney General of the country can really reflect and make a big change. Which country in the world, Attorney, tell me, has suo moto cognisance by the highest court? I’m sure I can’t look around. And Article 136 intervention was supposed to be a narrow-slit. The wall has been demolished with anything and everything under the sun, including what a magistrate has to do, what a Session Judge has to do, what a District Judge has to do, and what a High Court Judge has to do. That wall demolition is also hurting the arbitral process. All I am suggesting, in all humility and as a concerned citizen of this country, is that the issue you are debating is critical to micro and small industries. They want a facile, easy arbitral process”.

Jagdeep Dhankhar condemned Supreme Court’s “judicial overreach”, calling it an unelected ‘super Parliament’

In April 2025, VP Jagdeep Dhankhar harshly criticised the recent Supreme Court verdict regarding the powers of the Governor and the President under Articles 200 and 201 of the Constitution. In the Judgment passed on 8th April 2025, a division bench of the Supreme Court set a time limit, not envisaged in the Constitution, on the exercise of power to grant or refuse assent to a state Bill by the President and the Governor. The Supreme Court prescribed a deadline of 3 months on the President’s power to grant or refuse assent to a Bill reserved by the Governor for his consideration.

Without mincing words, VP Dhankhar questioned the Supreme Court for issuing a direction to the President of India. He reminded the Supreme Court that its power is limited to interpreting the Constitution. “We cannot have a situation where you direct the President of India, and on what basis? The only right you have under the Constitution is to interpret the Constitution under Article 145(3), ” said the Vice President in an address during the Valedictory Function of the 6th Rajya Sabha Internship Program at Vice-President’s Enclave on 17th April.

“The President is called upon to decide in a time-bound manner, and if not, it becomes law. So we have judges who will legislate, who will perform executive functions, who will act as super-parliament, and absolutely have no accountability because the law of the land does not apply to them,” he said.

Highlighting the fact that the judgment, which had the effect of modifying the concerned provisions, was delivered by a bench of two judges which did not represent the majority of the total number of judges in the Supreme Court.

“When Article 145(3) was there, the number of judges in the Supreme Court was eight, 5 out of 8, now 5 out of 30 and odd. But forget about it, the judges who issued a mandamus virtually to the President and presented a scenario that it will be the law of the land, have forgotten the power of the Constitution. How can that combination of judges deal with something under Article 145(3) if preserved, it was then for five out of eight. We need to make amends for that also now. Five out of eight would mean interpretation will be by majority. Well, five constitutes more than the majority in eight. But leave that aside. Article 142 has become a nuclear missile against Democratic forces, available to the judiciary 24 x 7,” Dhankhar said.

Notably, in the verdict passed in The State of Tamil Nadu v The Governor of Tamil Nadu and Anr, the Apex Court examined the ambit of powers of the President and the Governor conferred under Articles 200 and 201 of the Constitution. The Supreme Court held that the President should decide on the Bills sent to him by the Governor for consideration within 3 months, and that any delay beyond the prescribed time limit should be justified by recording reasons. Besides, the Court ruled that if the President fails to decide on a Bill within 3 months, then the State government can seek the issuance of the writ of mandamus from the Supreme Court against the President. The judgment has been widely criticised for alleged judicial overreach or a judicial attempt to effectively amend the constitution.

Dhankhar questioned the handling of the Justice Yashwant Varma case

Former Vice-President Dhankhar had also raised questions on how the Supreme Court handled the matter relating to the discovery of huge amounts of unaccounted cash at the house of Justice Yashwant Varma. “An event happened on the night of the 14th and 15th of March in New Delhi, at the residence of a judge. For seven days, no one knew about it. We have to ask questions to ourselves. Is the delay explainable? Condonable? Does it not raise certain fundamental questions? In any ordinary situation, and ordinary situations define the rule of law, things would have been different. It was only on 21st March, disclosed by a newspaper, that people of the country were shocked as never before, ” the Vice-President remarked.

“I support judicial independence — but ACCOUNTABILITY IS KEY.” pic.twitter.com/THpUDUe6aO — Megh Updates 🚨™ (@MeghUpdates) July 7, 2025

“Thereafter, fortunately, in the public domain, we had input from an authoritative source, the Supreme Court of India. And the input indicated culpability. Input did not lead to doubt that something was amiss. Something requires to be investigated. Now the nation waits with bated breath. The nation is restive because one of our institutions, to which people have always looked up with the highest respect and deference, was put in the dock,” he added.

Jagdeep Dhankhar: The man who questioned judicial overreach, sought accountability and advocated for balance of powers even in the face of backlash from the opposition and slandering by the leftist ecosystem

Dhankhar’s fierce critiques of what he deemed judicial overreach and encroachment of the powers of the legislature were not without pushback. Beyond the insulting mimicries, several opposition leaders labelled Dhankhar as ‘non-neutral’ and his comments slamming the judiciary ‘unconstitutional’. The opposition parties and the leftist media cabal even accused the former VP of ‘undermining’ judicial independence. Not to forget, the leftist propaganda portal The Wire went as far as to call Dhankhar a “partisan attack dog” over VP Dhankhar’s criticism of the Supreme Court for using Article 142 and calling it a “nuclear missile against democratic forces”.

Despite the slandering, mockery and criticism, Dhankhar did not shy away from raising concern over judicial overreach, particularly in matters involving a delicate balance of power among the judiciary, executive and legislature. Even in the judge Yaswant Varma case, Jagdeep Dhankhar publicly questioned the actions of the Supreme Court, raising concerns regarding accountability in a democracy wherein elected representatives are subject to scrutiny but judges are nearly immune to all sorts of accountability and scrutiny.

While the opposition and the leftist media ecosystem accused VP Dhankhar of delivering politically charged rhetoric at the behest of his ‘political masters’, the BJP, VP Dhankhar’s remarks were not politically charged or at odds with his constitutional duty, rather, his criticism of the judiciary was driven by a genuine concern over a pattern wherein the judiciary seems to be discharging the duties of President, and at times those of the Parliament as well.

Dhankhar’s courage, however, has not been surprising as even during his tenure as the governor of West Bengal, he repeatedly raised concern over post-poll violence in the state and severely criticised the TMC government for the Birbhum massacre. He remained at loggerheads with the CM Mamata Banerjee-led state government over issues pertaining to federalism and governance, condemning the near-collapse of democracy in the state.

While the opposition and its media cheerleaders mocked Jagdeep Dhankhar, belittled the importance of the Vice President’s post and projected the judiciary as somewhat sacrosanct to criticism, even moved a failed impeachment motion, Jagdeep Dhankhar stood his ground, not for personal gains, not for clout, not for political leverage, but for democracy, for constitution and the supremacy of the people’s mandate.

Several parliamentarians had earlier also raised concerns over judicial activism and overreach; however, Dhankhar’s interventions brought the debate to the forefront, triggering the judiciary, lawmakers and the public to ponder over the question of the judiciary’s role in a healthy democracy.

Jagdeep Dhankhar’s tenure as the Vice President of India and Rajya Sabha chairman will be remembered for many good reasons, especially his role as a defender of constitutional balance. He gave a fervent call for judicial accountability, critiqued judicial overreach while reiterating his belief in parliamentary supremacy. While the opposition parties gave him nothing but insults, mockery and hate, Dhankhar tried to accommodate opposition voices despite ideological differences. Dhankhar’s resignation marks the end of a chapter; however, the questions he raised about the judiciary’s role and accountability will continue to shape India’s constitutional discourse.",21st july

OpIndia,23/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/first-balasore-self-immolation-now-greater-noida-suicide-the-problem-of-harassment-of-students/,"First Balasore self-immolation, now Greater Noida suicide: Why do we need such tragedies to wake us up to the problem of harassment of students","Jyoti Sharma, a second-year student from Sharda University in Greater Noida, pursuing BDS, died by suicide in her hostel room. She passed away on July 18, Friday, reportedly after writing a suicide note. The note accuses two professors and the university administration of mental harassment. The two staff members, Mahinder and Shairy, have been arrested so far.

In the suicide letter, she wrote that she had been mentally harassed and humiliated for a long time, which caused her significant distress. She expressed her desire for the accused to face legal action. She held the teachers of PCP and Dental Materials responsible for her death.

The note reads, “They mentally harassed me. They humiliated me. I have been under stress because of them for a long time. I want them to face the same thing. I am sorry. I can’t live like this anymore. I can’t…”

Shortly after the incident came to light, students gathered and protested against the university administration, alleging negligence. They claimed Jyoti had been under immense stress due to accusations of forging signatures. A minor scuffle broke out between the protesters and the police, while the family of the deceased was seen manhandling the head of the dentistry department.

The incident occurred on Friday night, and a case has been filed at the Knowledge Park Police Station in Gautam Buddha Nagar. “The woman’s body has been sent for post-mortem, and two staff members of the university have been arrested on the basis of a complaint filed by the victim’s family,” said Additional DCP of Greater Noida, Sudhir Kumar.

He added that tension had escalated due to the anger among the deceased’s family and university students towards the administration. The anger and scuffle were defused by the police through dialogue, and peace was restored at the scene. Further legal proceedings are underway.

Dr. Ajit Kumar, the university’s Public Relations Officer, confirmed that two faculty members have been suspended. “For now, two teachers have been suspended. A committee has also been formed to investigate the matter. Action will be taken against those found guilty based on the committee’s report,” he stated.

This is not an isolated case of a student taking her life due to harassment. A similar incident took place in Odisha’s Balasore shocking self-immolation case on July 12. A 20-year-old girl set herself on fire, allegedly after enduring sexual harassment by the head of her college department. She suffered 90 percent burns and later succumbed to her injuries at AIIMS Bhubaneswar on July 14.

These brutal incidents show no discrimination based on gender or age. This was evident in the tragic case of a teenager from The Global Public School in Kerala who ended his life after reportedly being bullied, assaulted, and harassed by his schoolmates.

According to the teenager’s mother, on January 15, he was forcibly taken to the toilet and made to lick the seat; his head was then pushed into the toilet while it was flushed. He was also bullied for his skin tone. The relentless harassment severely affected his mental health, ultimately driving him to end his life by jumping from the 26th floor of their apartment building.

On April 30, 2023, a 16-year-old boy died by suicide after allegedly being mentally abused by his principal and faculty members. He purportedly left a suicide note in which he apologized to his parents and elder brothers and urged serious action against those who had harassed him. The boy allegedly died by suicide in Telangana, with his family accusing the college management and certain members of the teaching staff of harassment and holding them responsible for his death, police reported. The student, in his first year of intermediate studies at a private college in Narsingi, Telangana, was found hanging in a classroom by his friends on Tuesday night, April 30.

All these incidents reflect one painful similarity: before taking their own lives, the victims tried to express what they were going through and, in the end, wrote in their suicide notes. Instead of receiving empathy and support from those around them when they spoke up about harassment in educational institutions, their voices were often ignored. Their stories must be heard, and their grievances must be addressed before blaming the victim. Continued ignorance will only lead to more such tragedies unless educational institutions actively work towards providing safe, empathetic, and responsive environments for students.",jyoti sharma second year student sharda university greater noida pursuing bd died suicide hostel room passed away july 18 friday reportedly writing suicide note note accuses two professor university administration mental harassment two staff member mahinder shairy arrested far suicide letter wrote mentally harassed humiliated long time caused significant distress expressed desire accused face legal action held teacher pcp dental material responsible death note read “they mentally harassed humiliated stress long time want face thing sorry can’t live like anymore can’t…” shortly incident came light student gathered protested university administration alleging negligence claimed jyoti immense stress due accusation forging signature minor scuffle broke protester police family deceased seen manhandling head dentistry department incident occurred friday night case filed knowledge park police station gautam buddha nagar “the woman’s body sent post mortem two staff member university arrested basis complaint filed victim’s family ” said additional dcp greater noida sudhir kumar added tension escalated due anger among deceased’s family university student towards administration anger scuffle defused police dialogue peace restored scene legal proceeding underway dr ajit kumar university’s public relation officer confirmed two faculty member suspended “for two teacher suspended committee also formed investigate matter action taken found guilty based committee’s report ” stated isolated case student taking life due harassment similar incident took place odisha’s balasore shocking self immolation case july 12 20 year old girl set fire allegedly enduring sexual harassment head college department suffered 90 percent burn later succumbed injury aiims bhubaneswar july 14 brutal incident show discrimination based gender age evident tragic case teenager global public school kerala ended life reportedly bullied assaulted harassed schoolmate according teenager’s mother january 15 forcibly taken toilet made lick seat head pushed toilet flushed also bullied skin tone relentless harassment severely affected mental health ultimately driving end life jumping 26th floor apartment building april 30 2023 16 year old boy died suicide allegedly mentally abused principal faculty member purportedly left suicide note apologized parent elder brother urged serious action harassed boy allegedly died suicide telangana family accusing college management certain member teaching staff harassment holding responsible death police reported student first year intermediate study private college narsingi telangana found hanging classroom friend tuesday night april 30 incident reflect one painful similarity taking life victim tried express going end wrote suicide note instead receiving empathy support around spoke harassment educational institution voice often ignored story must heard grievance must addressed blaming victim continued ignorance lead tragedy unless educational institution actively work towards providing safe empathetic responsive environment student
OpIndia,23/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/truck-still-stuck-collapsed-gambhira-bridge-gujarat-as-media-blames-officials-know-what-happened/,"Truck still stuck on collapsed Gambhira bridge in Gujarat: As media blames officials, Anand district collector shares the real reason with OpIndia","After a part of the Gambhira Bridge connecting Saurashtra region and Central Gujarat collapsed on the morning of 9th July, 2025, a truck which got stuck on the bridge is still hanging there, fifteen days after the incident.

Some media reports based on the interviews of the truck driver and the owner claimed that the officials of the two districts of Anand and Vadodara are denying their accountability, which is causing unnecessary hardships to the truck driver and the owner, who have been running from pillar to post to get the truck removed. Pending EMIs are adding to the worries of the truck driver, who is not even able to claim the insurance.

A report in Divya Bhaskar quoted truck owner Ramashankar Pal as saying, ” The officials of the Anand government office are putting the responsibility on Vadodara, and the officials of Vadodara are putting the responsibility on Anand. We are tired of facing all the hassles. The officials replied that the army was also requested to remove the truck by helicopter, but there is no possibility of the truck being removed right now.”

The truck owner further told Bhaskar, “I have a loan on the truck and I have to pay an instalment of Rs 1 lakh every month. If the truck runs, I will be able to pay the instalment. The administration had given me an assurance for removing the truck, but even after so many days, I have not been able to get the truck.”

The title of the Divya Bhaskar report reads- ‘First the truck was hanging, now the officials are ‘hanging’ it: Even after 10 days of the accident, the truck is still on the Gambhira bridge, the driver is wandering to unload the truck, saying – there is an instalment of lakhs per month.’

A Gujarati News’ TV channel, GSTV wrote, ‘The government has raised its hands’, the situation of the truck owner is difficult, and no one is listening to him. It has also been claimed in this report that the truck owner has been doing the rounds of the government offices of Anand-Vadodara for ten days, but he did not get any response. “We have to pay the instalments for the truck. The bank is saying that we have to pay the instalments, while the insurance company is saying that the truck is safe, no insurance will be given,” said the truck owner as quoted by GSTV.

Anand District Collector spoke to OpIndia

When OpIndia contacted Anand District Collector Praveen Chaudhary regarding the entire matter, a different version came to light. He said that there is no dispute between the two districts, and neither is the delay due to the administration blaming each other. The reality is that the truck could not be removed due to some technical reasons that emerged during the rescue operation that lasted for several days. However, the Anand District Collectorate is providing all possible help to the truck owner.

Divulging the details about the entire incident, the Anand District Collector said, “After the bridge accident, it was impossible to take heavy machinery like cranes on the bridge due to technical reasons. The truck will need to be lifted from the front, which was damaged, using a crane. But the Road and Building Department believed that using a crane in such a situation is dangerous.” He said that the rescue operation has been going on continuously, and machines were deployed till yesterday. Now that the rescue operation is almost complete, a team from the mechanical wing of the Road and Building Construction Department is working on it in collaboration with a private company and experts from High Speed Railway Corporation Limited.

“Whether the truck should be pulled back or lifted by providing some support from below is being contemplated. It also has to be seen that there is no danger to any human life in this,” the District Collector said.

The truck was not removed, as a rescue operation was going on

The reason for the delay in removing the truck is that the rescue operation went on for several days after the accident. A tanker was not found, so a sonar machine was brought from Mumbai to search and locate it underwater. When the NDRF started the rescue operation after the incident, the district administration was requested to keep the stranded truck tied so that it would not pose any danger to the rescue efforts going on under the bridge, as the rescue operation was a priority at that time.

After discussing with the NDRF team, the district administration tied the truck to a crane from the back to ensure that the rescue operation went on unaffected. When the Army was consulted, it said that pushing or pulling the truck would require the involvement of people and would put their lives in danger. At present, technical teams of the Road and Building Department are working on the strategy to remove the truck ,and it will be disposed of soon. Teams from both the district administrations are also assisting in the operation.

The collector also clarified the issue of insurance and EMI

The Anand District Collector said that the truck owner visited his office and met him and the additional district magistrate, who explained everything to him. The owner agreed for the truck to be destroyed, but it has to be done in such a way that does not put any life in danger. The plan to do this is being worked out.

As far as insurance is concerned, the District Collector said that he met the insurance company. The company said that if the government gave a written certificate of the incident, they would approve the insurance claim. The collector’s office has also given assurance in this regard, and the written process will be completed with the company.

Regarding EMI, the collector said that although this is a matter between the bank and the truck owner, the administration cannot directly interfere in it, yet he wrote a letter to the bank and requested it to postpone the instalment for two to three months on humanitarian grounds. Also, a representation will be sent to the State Level Bankers Committee, so that the truck owner can get relief on EMI.

The District Collector made it clear that this is not an Anand-Vadodara issue. The area where this incident happened and the truck got stuck is entirely in Vadodara, but since the Vadodara administration was continuously engaged in the rescue operation, the Anand district administration stepped in and provided all possible assistance.",part gambhira bridge connecting saurashtra region central gujarat collapsed morning 9th july 2025 truck got stuck bridge still hanging fifteen day incident medium report based interview truck driver owner claimed official two district anand vadodara denying accountability causing unnecessary hardship truck driver owner running pillar post get truck removed pending emis adding worry truck driver even able claim insurance truck hanging broken gambhira bridge image via x theskindoctor13 report divya bhaskar quoted truck owner ramashankar pal saying ” official anand government office putting responsibility vadodara official vadodara putting responsibility anand tired facing hassle official replied army also requested remove truck helicopter possibility truck removed right ” truck owner told bhaskar “i loan truck pay instalment r 1 lakh every month truck run able pay instalment administration given assurance removing truck even many day able get truck ” title divya bhaskar report read ‘first truck hanging official ‘hanging’ even 10 day accident truck still gambhira bridge driver wandering unload truck saying – instalment lakh per month ’ gujarati news’ tv channel gstv wrote ‘the government raised hands’ situation truck owner difficult one listening also claimed report truck owner round government office anand vadodara ten day get response “we pay instalment truck bank saying pay instalment insurance company saying truck safe insurance given ” said truck owner quoted gstv anand district collector spoke opindia opindia contacted anand district collector praveen chaudhary regarding entire matter different version came light said dispute two district neither delay due administration blaming reality truck could removed due technical reason emerged rescue operation lasted several day however anand district collectorate providing possible help truck owner divulging detail entire incident anand district collector said “after bridge accident impossible take heavy machinery like crane bridge due technical reason truck need lifted front damaged using crane road building department believed using crane situation dangerous ” said rescue operation going continuously machine deployed till yesterday rescue operation almost complete team mechanical wing road building construction department working collaboration private company expert high speed railway corporation limited “whether truck pulled back lifted providing support contemplated also seen danger human life ” district collector said truck removed rescue operation going reason delay removing truck rescue operation went several day accident tanker found sonar machine brought mumbai search locate underwater ndrf started rescue operation incident district administration requested keep stranded truck tied would pose danger rescue effort going bridge rescue operation priority time discussing ndrf team district administration tied truck crane back ensure rescue operation went unaffected army consulted said pushing pulling truck would require involvement people would put life danger present technical team road building department working strategy remove truck disposed soon team district administration also assisting operation collector also clarified issue insurance emi anand district collector said truck owner visited office met additional district magistrate explained everything owner agreed truck destroyed done way put life danger plan worked far insurance concerned district collector said met insurance company company said government gave written certificate incident would approve insurance claim collector’s office also given assurance regard written process completed company regarding emi collector said although matter bank truck owner administration cannot directly interfere yet wrote letter bank requested postpone instalment two three month humanitarian ground also representation sent state level banker committee truck owner get relief emi district collector made clear anand vadodara issue area incident happened truck got stuck entirely vadodara since vadodara administration continuously engaged rescue operation anand district administration stepped provided possible assistance
OpIndia,23/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/pib-fake-news-samosa-jalebi-health-warning-cigarettes-media-news/,Fake claim: PIB calls out false media reports that union health ministry is set to issue health warning for samosa and jalebi like they...,"Many Indian media outlets, including Times of India and NDTV, recently published a news story alleging that popular Indian snacks and sweets such as samosa, jalebi and laddoo will be served alongside a health warning akin to those on cigarette packets. Furthermore, the new development was attributed to the Union Ministry of Health that it has been done in order to tackle health issues.

On 15th July, PIB fact-check, however, refuted the claims as false. It emphasized that the ministry’s advisory does not include any warning labels on food items sold by vendors and “has not been selective towards Indian snacks.”

Additionally, it clarified that the general recommendation is not unique to any one food product but rather serves as a “behavioural nudge” to alert consumers to “hidden fats and excess sugar in all food products.”

✅The general advisory is a behavioural nudge to make people aware of hidden fats and excess sugar in all food products, and not specifically to any particular food product.



The advisory is for healthier options and initiatives at workplaces and urges people to make healthier… pic.twitter.com/gD3f2XOeTF — PIB Fact Check (@PIBFactCheck) July 15, 2025

The agency added that the suggestion encourages “people to make healthier” decisions to reduce unnecessary sugar and oil in favour of a healthy diet and way of life as well as supports healthier workplace options and activities. “It does not target India’s rich street food culture,” it further pointed out.

What is in the letter

The ministry’s official letter identified “sharp rise in obesity in both children and adults” as a significant concern. It informed, “As per NFHS-5 (2019-21), over one in five adults in urban areas are overweight or obese. Prevalence of childhood obesity is impacted by poor dietary habits and reduced physical activity.”

It added, “As per The Lancet GBD 2021 obesity forecasting study, published in 2025, the number of overweight and obese adults in India is projected to rise from 18 crores in 2021 to 44.9 crores by 2050, making it the country with the second-highest global burden.” It stated that obesity dramatically increases the risk of non-communicable diseases like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease and several types of cancer.

The ministry pointed out, “It also affects mental health, mobility, and quality of life, and imposes a heavy economic burden through increased healthcare costs and productivity losses. Early prevention and health promotion are critical to reversing these trends.”

The letter outlined that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made a strong case for changing people’s lifestyles in order to fight obesity. “At the Opening Ceremony of the 38th National Games in Dehradun on 28th January 2025, Hon’ble Prime Minister invoked the Fit India Campaign and urged citizens to adopt active, healthy lifestyles as part of the broader vision of a Swasth Bharat. In his Mann Ki Baat, he called for a 10% reduction in oil consumption,” the official communiqué read.

It then conveyed, “In response to this national appeal, and as part of the ministry’s flagship initiatives under the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases (NP-NCD), it is imperative to promote sustainable behavioural changes in our workplaces. These include reducing excessive consumption of oil and sugar, both of which are key contributors to rising rates of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and other lifestyle-related disorders.”

According to the letter, it is advocating that Sugar and Oil Boards be displayed as an effort to encourage better eating practices in multiple settings. They will function as visual behavioural cues in public spaces like offices and schools, revealing important details including hidden sugars and fats in common food items.

Hence, a direction to all “departments/offices/autonomous bodies and other public institutions/organizations” under the ministry was sought.

The Print published a news article on July 8, 2025, in which it claimed that the health research department (DHR) of the Union Ministry of Health is collaborating with INCLEN (The International Clinical Epidemiology Network) International, a New Delhi-based health research organisation, to conduct a national, community-level study to examine the rise in deaths among people under 45 years of age.

Quoting INCLEN International Executive Director and proposed lead analyst N.K.

It added that “this larger study will analyse the trend of such deaths in an attempt to determine the risk factors for such mortalities”.

However, the Print news article was fact-checked by the PIB, which termed the claims made in it as fake.

Claims linking sudden deaths to COVID vaccine

Several claims linking sudden deaths caused by heart attack to the COVID-19 vaccine have been spreading across social media for years. However, the central government debunked all these claims earlier this month, on the grounds of two extensive studies conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research(ICMR) and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences. The studies found that there was no direct link between sudden deaths by heart attack and the COVID-19 vaccines.

Besides, studies by the ICMR and National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) affirmed that COVID-19 vaccines in India are safe and effective, with extremely rare instances of serious side effects. Sudden deaths due to heart attacks can be linked to a wide range of factors, including genetics, lifestyle, pre-existing conditions, and post-COVID complications.

To understand the causes of sudden, unexplained deaths, especially in young adults between the ages of 18 and 45 years, the ICMR and the NCDC conducted a study across 47 tertiary care hospitals in 19 states and UTs.

The book titled “Exploring Society: India and Beyond” introduces students to some important events and episodes in Indian history, including the Delhi Sultanate, the Mughal rule, the Maratha empire and the colonial period. The book has recently become the cause of a huge liberal meltdown.

The book has a chapter titled “Reshaping India’s Political Map”, which covers Indian history between the 13th and the 17th century, including the rise and fall of the Delhi Sultanate and the resistance to it, the Vijayanagar Empire, the Mughal Empire, and the resistance faced by them, and the rise of the Sikhs.

At the beginning of the book comes is a note for students, which gives them a contextual understanding of the inclusion of some dark historical episodes like the Islamic fundamentalism in the book and the approach to be adopted while studying them. “History sometimes seems to be full of wars and destruction… Should we omit them entirely? … The best approach is to face them and analyse them so as to understand what made such developments possible and, hopefully, help avoid their recurrence in future. It is important to study those darker developments dispassionately, without blaming anyone living today for them… The past continues to live with us and shapes the present.”

To be introduced in schools from the 2025-26 academic year, the book attempts to provide a complete picture of historical events or periods included in it by retaining their negative as well as positive aspects. While the book mentions how Mughal rulers Jahangir and Shah Jahan patronised art and architecture, it also highlights the brutalities of Babur, who massacred the entire populations of cities. It describes Aurangzeb as a military ruler who banned un-Islamic practices and reimposed taxes on non-Muslims and defines the rule of Mughal ruler Akbar, the left-liberal coterie’s poster boy of the Mughal period, as a “blend of brutality and tolerance”.

But the left liberals, who are habitual of using history as a tool to further their agenda, have a problem with it. They have a problem because the facade built by leftist historians who downplayed and whitewashed the brutalities of Islamic invaders and justified their atrocities against Hindus is crumbling. For a long time, they pushed a false narrative by portraying Mughal King Akbar as the epitome of religious tolerance. They eulogised him for abolishing the Jizya tax, a religious tax levied by Muslim rulers on Hindus and other non-Muslims for merely existing in an Islamic regime, but cleverly omitted to mention how he waged Jihad against Hindus during the seige of Chittorgarh and ordered the massacre of 30,000 Hindus populace.

The seige of Chittoragarh

By 1567, Mughal ruler Akbar had managed to get most parts of northern India under his control. Now, he was eyeing the Kingdom of Mewar, which was being ruled by the Suryavanshi Sisodia Rajput dynasty at that time, under Rana Udai Singh II. The Mewar kingdom stood as a symbol of resistance against the Mughal Empire, which had subdued most of the surrounding kingdoms. Akbar decided to launch a military expedition to besiege the Mewar capital at Chittorgarh and termed it as ‘Jihad’ against the infidels (Hindus).

Chittorgarh, situated in present-day Rajasthan, was a formidable fort spanning across 700 acres, situated atop 180 a high hill in the heart of the Mewar Kingdom. The fortress had survived the sieges by Aluddin Khilji (1303) and Bahadur Shah of Gujarat (1535).

Refusing to bow down before the Mughal emperor, Rana Udai Singh II geared up to defend his kingdom. In October 1567, Akbar marched from Agra with his army of 40,000 men equipped with cannons, muskets and siege equipment, aiming to bring the Mewar Kingdom to its knees. Inside the Chittorgarh fort was an army of 8000 Rajput warriors prepared to defend their pride. On the advice of his counsels, Rana Udai Singh II moved to his principality in the Aravali hills and left the Rajput army under the command of Jaimal Rathore.

The Mughal army strategically set up their camp at the base of the Chittorgarh hill to cut off supplies to the fort. The siege began, and both armies soon engaged in a full-fledged battle with arrows, musket shots and cannon shots flying across the sky. The Mughal army was struggling to penetrate the 30-feet-thick walls of the Chittorgarh fort. The Mughal soldiers made several strategies to breach the mighty walls of the Chittorgarh fort. They tried to stealthily march towards the base of the fort through covered trenches and dig burrows under the foundation of the fort and pack gunpowder in them to blow up the fort’s base. However, the Rajput armies were watching them. They dug counter-mines and resisted the Mughal armies, which suffered heavy losses.

The battle went on for months, till the fateful day when the Rajput commander Jaimal Rathore fell. There are varied accounts of the cause of Jaimal Rathore’s death. Some accounts say that he died from a musket shot fired by Akbar on February 22, 1568. Other accounts mention that Rathore was killed by Mughal marksmen. Jaimal Rathore’s death was a turning point in the battle, as the Rajput armies were demoralised and the Mughal armies were able to breach the fort. As soon as the fort was breached by the Mughal armies, the Rajput women inside the fort performed jauhar to protect their honour from the enemy. The remaining Rajput soldiers put up a final resistance before the Mughal armies and laid down their lives, before the fort was finally captured on February 23-24, 1568.

Some Mughal sources say that the Rajput armies of about 8000-10,000 men were entirely killed. Mughal king Akbar, who was frustrated and enraged by the stiff resistance put up by the Rajput armies, proclaimed the siege of Chittorgarh and the victory of Islam over infidels and ordered the massacre of the entire civilian population of around 30,000 people. The men were killed, and several women and children were enslaved.

But, according to left-liberals, Mughal King Akbar was a liberal and tolerant ruler, who abolished the Jizya tax, and not a cruel, intolerant tyrant who ordered the slaughter of thousands of innocent, unarmed Hindu civilians of the Chittorgarh fort, who posed no harm to him. This special ability to see one truth by ignoring the other truth is peculiar to the left-liberals. The only acceptable truth to them is their version of truth, no matter how incomplete, selective or even untrue it is.

This unique quality of theirs begs the question, Jo cheez jaisi hai usey vaisa usey vaisa he pesh kyo na kiya jaye, taat ko resham kyo kaha jaye?

It has been revealed that humans lived in that are around 4,000 years ago. Scientists who were searching for additional information about the captivating location in the Raichur district made the discovery. A collaborative team of 20 researches from India, Canada and the United States worked together to learn more about the area’s past.

Researchers have been excavating around Mallikarjun Hill, close to the Mallikarjuna Temple and the town’s Anjaneya Swamy temple. They have come across a variety of artefacts and other tools that date back four millennia which suggests that the area was once a vibrant settlement.

Professor Dr Andrew M. Bauer of Stanford University in the United States, Dr. Peter G. Johansen of McGill University in Canada and Hemanth Kadambi of Shiv Nadar University in Delhi-NCR (National Capital Region) alongside their team of over 20 researchers have been seeking evidence of human habitation and civilisation in Maski for the past three months.

They approached Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) for approval and afterward the crew began exploring Maski. The scientists identified 271 places of interest in the area and began their work. They unearthed evidence that the area surrounding the temple and Mallikarjun Hill was occupied by people from the 11th to the 14th century BCE.

They located an array of antiquities, including cooking tools like earthen pots and pans. Kadambi declared, “We have found evidence that indicates that there was a human settlement in Maski around 4,000 years ago.”

Maski inscription

Notably, British gold mine engineer C. Beadon found the Maski inscription in 1915. The region made its place on the archaeological map when the inscription, which dates to the time of the Mauryan emperor Ashoka, came to light. It was etched onto a rock surface within a cave.

One of the earliest inscriptions from the Mauryan era, it prominently displays the emperor’s name and his title as “Devanampriya” (Beloved of the Gods). A long-standing disagreement about whether the legendary ruler was actually referred to by the title or not was resolved when the same was mentioned alongside his name. It was written in Brahmi script and in the Prakrit language, highlighting his adherence to non-violence.",remarkable archaeological finding drawn attention karnataka’s maski town revealed human lived around 4 000 year ago scientist searching additional information captivating location raichur district made discovery collaborative team 20 research india canada united state worked together learn area’s past researcher excavating around mallikarjun hill close mallikarjuna temple town’s anjaneya swamy temple come across variety artefact tool date back four millennium suggests area vibrant settlement professor dr andrew bauer stanford university united state dr peter g johansen mcgill university canada hemanth kadambi shiv nadar university delhi ncr national capital region alongside team 20 researcher seeking evidence human habitation civilisation maski past three month approached archaeological survey india asi approval afterward crew began exploring maski scientist identified 271 place interest area began work unearthed evidence area surrounding temple mallikarjun hill occupied people 11th 14th century bce located array antiquity including cooking tool like earthen pot pan kadambi declared “we found evidence indicates human settlement maski around 4 000 year ago ” maski inscription notably british gold mine engineer c beadon found maski inscription 1915 region made place archaeological map inscription date time mauryan emperor ashoka came light etched onto rock surface within cave one earliest inscription mauryan era prominently display emperor’s name title “devanampriya” beloved god long standing disagreement whether legendary ruler actually referred title resolved mentioned alongside name written brahmi script prakrit language highlighting adherence non violence

While the attack itself was disturbing, what sparked further indignation was how Irish mainstream media chose to report the incident.

Instead of unequivocally condemning the brutality, reports used language that cast doubt on the nature of the crime, referring to it as an “alleged assault” despite the visible and horrific injuries sustained by the victim. This minimisation of violence, which bore all the hallmarks of a racially motivated hate crime, was called out in strong terms by the Indian Ambassador to Ireland, Akhilesh Mishra.

Ambassador Akhilesh Mishra exposes media bias over assault against an Indian origin man

Ambassador Mishra’s comments came with images of news reports that chose to cast doubt over the victim’s trauma, a strategy not unfamiliar to those tracking media narratives targeting Hindus globally. In doing so, Mishra highlighted an uncomfortable truth: that certain Western media institutions would rather gaslight Indian victims than confront the racial or ideological motivations behind such hate crimes.

The incident: A false accusation, brutal assault, and media whitewashing

The Indian man, who had arrived in Ireland just three weeks earlier, was assaulted and partially stripped in public in Tallaght on Saturday evening, July 19. According to The Irish Times, a mob confronted the man and falsely accused him of acting inappropriately around children, claims that were later disseminated online as part of a digital witch-hunt.

Irish police (Gardaí) have since confirmed that no evidence exists to support the accusations, yet the man was violently attacked, left bleeding, and taken to Tallaght University Hospital with serious injuries. Gardaí are now investigating the case as a possible hate crime, and there is speculation that the attack was racially motivated.

Local councillor Baby Pereppadan (Fine Gael) visited the victim and said he remains in shock and is not taking visitors. “Small incidents like these are happening frequently in Tallaght,” he warned, urging stronger police deployment in the area.

Sinn Féin TD Seán Crowe condemned the mob action as “vile and utterly unacceptable.” “Anyone who thinks this sort of mindless, racist violence makes their community safer is lying and fooling no one. This is not the first such attack in our area but it has to be the last,” he said.

A pattern of dehumanisation: Global racism targeting Hindus

While people of colour, especially Africans and South-East Asians, have long faced discrimination in the West, the treatment meted out to Indians, and Hindus in particular, reveals a unique and consistent pattern of prejudice. Hindus are not just exoticised or mocked; they are systematically demonised, dehumanised, and often blamed for the crimes of their persecutors.

Nowhere is this more apparent than in the disturbing trends on social media platforms where Hindu identity, symbols, and customs are routinely mocked with impunity.

From derogatory “cow piss” jibes to offensive caricatures of Hindu deities, the Hinduphobia is not just a cultural issue; it is a civilisational struggle where polytheistic traditions and Sanatan values are targeted by both far-left ideologues and right-wing supremacists, particularly in the West.

One need only look at the case of Stew Peters, a self-styled “America First” commentator who in 2024 described Hindus as “dot-headed cockroaches,” falsely alleging that Indians smear cow dung on their faces. Or Laura Loomer, who launched a xenophobic tirade against Indian-American Sriram Krishnan following his appointment to a senior AI policy position at the White House, calling Indians “third-world invaders.”

The vitriol extended far beyond individuals. Hindu deities like Maa Kali and Lord Ganesha were called “supervillains,” “demonic,” and “unfit for a first-world Christian country.” These sentiments are not just isolated outbursts but part of a coordinated campaign to otherise and vilify the Hindu community, especially those living proudly and unapologetically in the diaspora.

And this bigotry is undergirded by latent racism against Indians, particularly Hindus, and it rises to the surface every now and then, in both physical and psychological form —from attacking them literally as witnessed in Dublin to more sophisticated forms of assault — Hindumisic conferences organised in western universities that serve to legitimise such racism and give way to its more dangerous siblings, bigotry and dehumanisation.

The “Dismantling Global Hindutva” Conference: Institutionalised hatred of Hindus

Perhaps the most blatant example of institutionalised Hinduphobia came in the form of the “Dismantling Global Hindutva” conference held in September 2021. Sponsored by over 60 academic departments from 45+ universities, primarily in the United States, the three-day event brought together some of the most vocal and virulent anti-Hindu activists in academia and media.

The speakers list read like a who’s who of Hindumisia, including Audrey Truschke, Anand Patwardhan, Nandini Sundar, and Neha Dixit, individuals known for drawing false equivalences between Hindutva and Nazism. Ironically, the event’s poster depicted an inverted hammer violently uprooting a saffron-clad RSS Swayamsevak, a visual metaphor for the organised dismantling of Hindu civilisational identity.

The hammer, disguised as a pencil, was meant to portray “academic critique,” but its Nazi-esque symbolism mirrored the Röhm Putsch imagery of Nazi propaganda, where ‘eliminating violent elements’ was used to justify political murders. In this case, the target wasn’t a rogue militia. It was a symbolic attack on Hindus who dare to be assertive about their culture and beliefs.

The points of discussion during the conference followed a classic Goebbelsian propaganda template: select a few emotive triggers, repeat them endlessly, and cast your enemies as the threat to civilisation. It’s a strategy that paves the way for dehumanisation and, eventually, justifies violence.

The RSS or other Hindu organisations targeted aren’t paramilitary thugs. They are groups that aid flood victims, rescue women from trafficking, or assist during pandemics, tasks most self-proclaimed ‘liberal saviours’ wouldn’t touch. So why label them “militant”?

Because self-defence, cultural reclamation, and Hindu unity threaten the ideological monopoly of Islamists, Marxists, and global evangelists.

Research reveals a disturbing surge in Hinduphobic slurs and hate speech across social media platforms

A comprehensive 2023 study by the Network Contagion Research Institute (NCRI) lends credence to Mishra’s concerns. The report, ‘Quantitative Methods for Investigating Anti-Hindu Disinformation’, found a sharp rise in derogatory and genocidal content targeting Hindus across platforms like 4Chan, Telegram, Gab, and Twitter. These include memes and slurs such as “pajeet”, a racial epithet used to mock and dehumanise Hindus, alongside visual propaganda depicting Hindu symbols like tilaks and saffron clothing being subjected to ISIS-style beheadings or Nazi-style executions. The analysis also showed that the usage of such coded hate terms surged dramatically around key geopolitical events involving India, indicating coordinated disinformation efforts.

Perhaps most alarmingly, the NCRI discovered that Iranian state-sponsored troll networks were deeply involved in disseminating Hinduphobic content, often under fake Pakistani identities. These accounts strategically amplified hashtags and tropes accusing Hindus of genocide, inflaming caste divisions, and misrepresenting communal incidents like the 2020 Delhi riots. The trolls pretended to be human rights activists while tagging major news outlets like CNN and MSNBC to internationalise their narrative. This manipulation of digital platforms for geopolitical ends shows that Hinduphobia is not merely social bigotry; it is being weaponised as a tool of hybrid warfare.

The incident in Dublin, therefore, is not just a case of individual victimisation, it is a symptom of a transnational campaign to dehumanise Hindus in both physical and ideological realms. The assault, followed by media whitewashing, echoes the same patterns identified in the NCRI report: digital dehumanisation leading to real-world violence. Mishra’s remarks, then, are not only a defence of one man’s dignity but a broader call to recognise and confront the systemic erasure of Hindu identity under the guise of liberal tolerance.

From Anti-CAA protests to Digital pogroms

The dehumanisation of Hindus gained major momentum during the anti-CAA protests in India. Posters morphed the sacred Om into Nazi swastikas, women wearing bindis were portrayed as oppressors, and slogans like “Hinduon se Azadi” (Freedom from Hindus) echoed across protest sites. The song “Jab sab but tod diye jaayenge, bas Allah ka naam rahega” (“When all idols are broken, only Allah’s name shall remain”) was not fringe. It was mainstream. And it was celebrated.

This same contempt now fuels the global narrative, where being a proud Hindu in the West is considered an act of aggression, and where Indian immigrants are seen not as contributors, but cultural contaminants.

Are Hindus “invading” the West?

Contrary to the far-right and leftist narrative, Hindus aren’t flooding Western countries. As per Pew Research (2024):

Hindus make up only 5% of the global migrant population. Though 94% of Hindus live in India, only 57% of global Hindu migrants are from India. In contrast, Christians form 47% and Muslims 29% of global migrants.

The “Hindu invasion” is a myth, an imaginary construct, a bogeyman to manufacture hate.

From Dublin to Dismantling Hindutva: A global war on Hindus?

The Dublin assault and its casual dismissal by mainstream media is more than just a reporting failure. It is a symptom of a larger disease — a civilisational bias against Hindus that spans continents, cultures, and ideologies.

From hate crimes on the streets of Ireland and America to academic witch hunts like Dismantling Global Hindutva, Hindus today are not just being targeted physically, but also intellectually, politically, and spiritually.

Ambassador Akhilesh Mishra’s tweet is not just a diplomatic protest; it is a call to wake up. To recognise that being Hindu, wearing saffron, reciting shlokas, or simply existing unapologetically, is enough to be branded a target.

The question is no longer whether Hindus are being demonised. The question is: How long will we pretend that it’s not happening?

How online hatred fuels real-world attacks on Indians and Hindus

The Tallaght assault is a chilling reminder that online hate doesn’t just remain on the internet, it metastasizes into real-world violence.

In this case, false accusations against the Indian victim were first circulated online, accusing him of inappropriate behaviour near children. These baseless claims spread like wildfire on local WhatsApp groups and Facebook pages, ultimately emboldening a mob to hunt him down, strip him, beat him, and leave him bleeding on the street.

This incident mirrors a disturbing trend: social media platforms have become hotbeds for anti-Indian and anti-Hindu bigotry, often driven by coordinated misinformation campaigns and algorithmic

The Druze-majority province of Sweida, long considered a relatively stable enclave in a strife-torn country, has plumbed into chaos after violent clashes erupted between Druze self-defence militias and armed Sunni Bedouin tribes.

The Syrian government’s decision to intervene, ostensibly to restore order, has instead drawn fierce criticism, with eyewitnesses and human rights observers accusing Damascus of using the unrest as a pretext to carry out a brutal crackdown on the Druze community.

As the conflict spirals, disturbing reports have emerged of field executions, looting, and arson carried out by state forces and their allies. The violence has laid bare the fragile nature of Syria’s post-Assad political transition, with interim president Ahmed al-Sharaa, himself a former jihadist commander, struggling to maintain legitimacy among minority groups.

What was once framed as a peacekeeping operation is now seen by many Druze as a calculated campaign of ethnic and sectarian cleansing, pushing the region toward open rebellion and international intervention.

Syrian officials have faced allegations of conducting summary executions of civilians in the Druze-dominated Sweida. Damascus sent troops to the region after Druze fighters and Sunni Bedouin tribes clashed, which killed several people, including women and children. Afterwards, the country’s defence minister Murhaf Abu Qasra declared a ceasefire in the city on 15th July as government forces arrived in the morning.

The “notables and dignitaries” of the city had reached an agreement, he stated and added that government forces would “respond only to the sources of fire and deal with any targeting by outlaw groups.” Nonetheless, altercations were witnessed as did complaints of human right breaches by security personnel.

The locals accused government troops and their allies of tearing through Druze neighbourhoods. They informed AFP that the development had little impact on the ground. The interior ministry also admitted that the conflicts persisted into the evening.

On the same day, the United Kingdom-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights unveiled that 21 members of the minority group had been killed in and around the region by Syrian government forces and their aides.

According to the war monitor, the violence which broke out since early 13th July already claimed the lives of at least 248 people, comprising 92 Druze and 28 of them were civilians. The observatory previously highlighted that forces from the “defence and interior ministries carried out field executions of 12 (19 per some reports) civilians after storming the Radwan family guest house in the city of Sweida.”

It further mentioned that armed groups associated with the government were also accountable for the shooting of three siblings in the presence of their mother in Sweida province. Rayan Maarouf, the editor-in-chief of the Suwayda 24 news website revealed that security forces had been involved in “savage practices.”

He pointed out that there have been instances of brutal murders of civilians and expressed, “dozens of them, yet we do not possess accurate figures.” Suwayda 24 further informed that more than 200 people had been injured. Social media posts featured videos of armed combatants abusing Druze prisoners and shaving their beards.

The agency disclosed that the defence ministry employees took part in “systematic acts of vandalism targeting civilian homes and property” and “stealing the contents of homes, smashing doors and windows, and then setting fire to some of them” among other acts of crimes. Men in military outfits were observed robbing and burning houses as well as liquor stores.

The government troops entered the city with Bedouin fighters and accompanied them in attacking the Druze, according to the observatory, Druze leaders and witnesses. Gunfire and dead bodies laying on empty streets were reported by an AFP correspondent who landed in Sweida soon after the forces.

“Catastrophic” is how one Suweida local described the situation, adding that indiscriminate firing has caused residents to “flee towards the countryside” in spite of a curfew imposed by Syrian authorities, reported BBC Arabic.

Concern among the Druze increased when Islamist groups connected with the Syrian government joined the conflict leading a prominent member of the community to demand “international protection.” The majority of Druze religious leader also announced that they were in favour of the government’s deployment following the Bedouin violence.

However, they later called for armed resistance as the unrest escalated and voiced, “We are being subject to a total war of extermination,” and urged the Druze population “to confront this barbaric campaign with all means available.”

The authorities have been ordered to “take immediate legal action against anyone proven to have committed a transgression or abuse, regardless of their rank or position,” according to a statement released by former Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) commander and current interim president Ahmad al-Sharaa.

Tit-for-tat kidnappings and attacks between local Bedouin tribes and Druze armed forces in the southern province sparked bloodshed two days after a Druze businessman was kidnapped on the highway to Damascus. This marked the first deployment of Syrian government forces to Suweida since the Islamist-led rebels ousted President Bashar al-Assad in December.

Israel enters the conflict

Israel conveyed that after two days of deadly sectarian riots, it had targeted the government forces in the vicinity of Sweida as they moved into the largely Druze city. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu maintained that the government “intended to use (them) against the Druze.” Hence, he ordered strikes on forces and weapons in the area.

Israel with its own Druze population has promised to defend the members of the community who are living in Syria. It views any military deployment south of Damascus as a security hazard and has cautioned the Syrian government against the same. It vowed to continue the assault to protect the group.

On the other hand, the Syrian foreign ministry insisted that the strikes killed several civilians and members of the security forces, but failed to offer any exact numbers. The ministry denounced the Israeli attacks in a statement.

It termed them as “a reprehensible example of ongoing aggression and foreign interference in the internal affairs of sovereign states” and “a blatant violation of the sovereignty of the Syrian Arab Republic.”

Israel, nevertheless, complied with the Trump administration’s request to stop its strikes. The United States even deployed tanks to the troubled area. According to the country’s Syria envoy Tom Barrack, the US is communicating with all parties “to navigate towards calm and integration.”

The U.S. official claimed the Syrian government had informed Israel in advance that it was sending tanks to the Sweida area in southern Syria and stressed this was not an action directed at Israel but an attempt to restore order in internal clashes between Druze militias and a… https://t.co/a7SzPzx9AV — Barak Ravid (@BarakRavid) July 15, 2025

The recent camaraderie between Donald Trump and Ahmed al-Sharaa surprised many, as the former referred to the ex-Islamic terrorist as a “young, attractive and tough guy.” Washington even rescinded the $10 million bounty on his head and removed sanctions placed on Syria.

With the overthrow of Assad regime, the Jewish state has adopted a tough posture towards Syria’s new authorities, arguing it does not want terrorists along its borders. Israeli forces have executed hundreds of airstrikes on Syrian military targets and taken control of a United Nations-patrolled buffer zone on Syrian territory near the Golan Heights border.

Who are the minority Druze community

The majority of the nearly one million members of the Druze Arab sect reside in Syria, Lebanon and Israel. The group which originated in Egypt in the eleventh century, is an offshoot of Ismailism, branch of Shia Islam that forbids marriages and conversions to or from the faith.

The Druze are mostly found in three major provinces in the southern part of Syria, near the Israeli-ruled Golan Heights. They primarily reside in the Sweida province and a few Damascus suburbs, especially in Ashrafiyat Sahnaya and Jaramana to the south.

The Golan Heights, a strategically located plateau that Israel annexed in 1981 after capturing it from Syria during the 1967 Six-Day War is inhabited by around 20,000 Druze. There are about 25,000 Jews also staying in over 30 villages on the territory.

When Israel took over Golan, the majority of the Druze who identify as Syrian, turned down an offer of Israeli citizenship. Israeli residency cards were issued to those who declined although they are not regarded as the country’s citizens.

There is a Druze diaspora outside of the Middle East, especially in North America and Australia. Their population was expected to be over 700,000 until Syria’s civil conflict broke out in 2011. The Druze have been migrating to southern Syria since the 16th century, to what is now known as Jabal al-Druze or Druze Mountain in Sweida province, according to historian Sami Makarem’s book “The Druze Faith.”

During the ten-year civil war, the Druze who form the majority in the Suwayda region in southern Syria were pushed between the forces of the previous Assad administration and extremist organisations. Druze militias had retained a strong hold on Suweida, resisting appeals to join the security forces.

As the nation then took pride in its secular and Arab nationalist system, religious freedom was ensured under the strict control of the Assad family. Ahmed al-Sharaa also promised to safeguard them, however, his government is regarded with suspicion by them and other minorities.

The new 23-member Syrian cabinet unveiled in late March only featured one Druze member, Minister of Agriculture Amjad Badr, despite the transitional government’s commitment to incorporate minorities, including the Druze.

Earlier, many Druze citizens were slain including extrajudicially, as a result of sectarian warfare against their militias by Syrian transitional government armed forces and associated outfits that started on 28th April. Likewise, Christian and Alawite minority communities faced severe persecution few months after the new administration took charge.

Ahmed al-Sharaa’s ties to terrorism

The war name of Ahmed al-Sharaa was Abu Mohammad al-Jawlani. The United States classified him as a terrorist and the United Nations (UN) proscribed him. Over the past 20 years, he held significant positions in global terrorist organisations like Al Qaeda and ISIS. He was designated a global terrorist in 2013.

He collaborated closely with ISIS chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and Al Qaeda’s Aiman al-Zawahiri. He was instructed by the former to start a local outfit to provide a front for Al Qaeda Iraq and Syria during the 2011 uprising against the Assad regime. The Al-Nusrah Front also called Jabhat al-Nusrah or Jabhat Fatah al-Sham was founded by him in 2012.

This UN-designated terrorist group was officially acknowledged as the Syrian branch of Al Qaeda. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham or HTS became the new name for the Jabhat Fatah al-Sham in 2017. Its main objectives were to overthrow the Assad government and establish an Islamic Caliphate.

The group spearheaded a swift and widespread assault and seized areas which were under the Assad government. Afterward, retaliatory killings became rampant in Syria following Ahmed al-Sharaa’s takeover as his Sunni hardliner supporters and radicals targeted people from minority communities.

Therefore, while some Druze opposed Bashar al-Assad’s dictatorial government, they are also wary of Ahmed al-Sharaa, an Islamist leader with a history of perpetrating Islamic jihad. Reservations about some of their leaders being left out of his national discussion processes have been presented by them.",began localised tribal scuffle southern syria snowballed full blown

OpIndia,23/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/keeladi-excavation-controversy-over-the-asi-report-by-amarnath-ramakrishna-why-is-the-tn-govt-at-loggerheads-with-asi-and-centre-over-it/,Keeladi excavation and controversy over the ASI report by Amarnath Ramakrishna: Why is the TN govt at loggerheads with ASI and Centre over it,"The excavation at Keeladi, located in Tamil Nadu, unveiled proof of an early urbanized society in South India, which captivated the interest of the whole nation. The first stages of the initiative, started in 2014, were headed by archaeologist K Amarnath Ramakrishna.

However, a significant political dispute between the Tamil Nadu government and the centre has unfolded by his repeated transfers and the Archaeological Survey of India’s (ASI) reservations about his excavation report.

K Amarnath is now appointed as the Director of the National Mission on Monuments and Antiquity (NMMA) in Greater Noida. He was employed as the Director of the National Mission on Monuments and Antiquity in New Delhi prior to the transfer, which occurred six months after his last assignment. He had previously spent three months in the position of Director for Excavation and Exploration.

K Amarnath was ordered to modify his report by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), however, he denied to comply, leading to a fierce war of words between the central and state governments.

How it all began: The Keeladi findings and its significance

Keeladi also known as Keezhadi is on the Vaigai river basin, situated in the Sivaganga district, approximately 12 kilometers southeast of Madurai. Excavations were started more than ten years ago at the Pallichanthai Tidal in Keeladi which was once a 100-acre coconut grove by Amarnath Ramakrishna, the ASI’s superintending archaeologist at the time. Keeladi stood out among the over 100 locations he had selected for excavation along the Vaigai River.

Over 7,500 ancient artefacts, such as wells, drainage systems and wall structures were discovered there, pointing to a thriving and advanced urban society. These materials were disclosed to be more than 2,160 years old, dating to the second century BCE (Before Common Era) which coincides with Tamil history’s Sangam period, according to carbon dating.

The ASI conducted the first three of the eight rounds of excavations. After the Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology (TNSDA) assumed responsibility for the project, the artefacts accumulated to over 18,000, which included pottery, inscribed potsherds, gold ornaments, copper articles, semi-precious stones, shell and ivory bangles, glass beads, spindle whorls, terracotta seals, and weaving tools.

The location produced more than 120 potsherds with Tamil Brahmi inscriptions. The discovery alongside thousand inscribed potsherds from other areas demonstrated the script’s continued existence in the region. Copper needles, clay seals, spinning whorls, yarn hanging stones, terracotta spheres, and earthen containers for liquids alluded to different stages of the weaving industry.

They also indicated that Keeladi was a strong, well-planned and sophisticated urban community with traces of businesses like beadmaking, dyeing and pottery. The artistic, culturally diverse and affluent lifestyle of the Keeladi people is reflected in gold decorations, copper objects, semi-precious stones, shell bangles, ivory bangles and ivory combs.

Beads made of carnelian and agate reflected importation through business networks. Furthermore, their recreational interests had been disclosed through the uncovering of terracotta and ivory dice, gamesmen and signs of hopscotch which also revealed the presence of an elite society. It was also unearthed that the area’s fertility and cow husbandry were key factors in its development, opening the door for the locals to engage in sea trading and produce an abundance of rice.

The results showcased a far older and more developed civilisation than previously believed, pushing the Sangam Age in Tamil Nadu back to about 800 BCE, as per reports. The Sangam Age, also known as the Tamil Sangam period, is a significant period in the history of South India. It was named for the Sangam, an assembly of Tamil poets and academics, saw a flourishing of literature and culture in southern India. It was generally accepted to have occurred between approximately 300 BCE and 300 CE (Common Era).

The Keeladi objects displayed certain symbols that were similar to those of the Indus Valley Civilization. However, there is cultural separation of roughly 1,000 years and scholars anticipated that more research would shed light on this relationship.

Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology asserted that Keeladi possessed all the hallmarks of an urban civilisation, including brick buildings, upscale goods and evidence of both domestic and international trade. It presented itself as a highly developed and hard-working civilisation and provided proof of Tamil Nadu’s urban life and settlements throughout the Early Historic Period. Additionally, Keeladi only strengthened Sangam Literature’s legitimacy.

Strong structures orientated in cardinal directions unveiled systematic urban planning and pot fragments with Tamil Brahmi inscriptions confirmed a literate culture. The sun and moon graffiti revealed the people’s astronomical awareness.

Keeladi was an urban town from the Sangam era and the cultural deposits discovered during the fourth phase of excavations could be easily dated to a time between the sixth and first centuries BCE, according to a 2019 report from the Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology. One of the six samples sent to the United States for carbon testing was dated 580 BCE. It was taken at a depth of 353 centimetres.

Notably, according to the findings presented in the report, the Keeladi artefacts date back approximately 300 years earlier than the previously believed 3rd century BCE.

Ramakrishna’s discovery and subsequent transfer

Keeladi was found by Amarnath Ramakrishna, who supervised the first two seasons of excavations from 2014 to 2016 and handed over a 982-page report to ASI Director General V. Vidyavathi. The report’s twelve chapters provided an explanation of the excavation’s goals and historical context.

The 23 samples that were dated using Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) at the Beta Analytical Lab in Florida of the United States were covered in a different chapter. It also incorporated research on floral and faunal remains from the site to arrive at the period, as well as discoveries from other universities, as per reports.

The first two phases of excavation at Keeladi yielded about 5,800 artefacts after which Ramakrishna was transferred to Assam. The action was reportedly viewed as a setback to the effort. The centre was accused by critics of purposefully sabotaging the excavations because it had committed to release funds and support for additional digging, but postponed both.

Meanwhile, the excavations had already progressed into their third phase under archaeologist PS Sriraman. Interestingly, Sriraman announced that there was no continuity in the brick constructions that had been found earlier, after 400 square meters of excavation. As a result, claims emerged from Tamil Nadu that the centre was actively ‘downplaying’ Keeladi’s prominence, aided by the usual political narratives of anti-North India sentiments that is seen in Tamil political discourse.

TN Govt took up excavation project after ASI stopped, found 13,000 more items

The ASI halted excavations at the site, arguing that the third phase produced no significant outcomes. However, the work was taken over by the Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology in 2017 and thousands of artefacts have since been unearthed. The ninth phase of the excavations was launched by Chief Minister MK Stalin in April 2023 and ended in September of the same year.

The Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology has been able to uncover more than 13,000 items and acquire radiocarbon dates from 580 BCE to 200 CE. The excavations, entered their tenth phase by 2024-2025 and already produced hundreds of antiques.

Furthermore, a 30-foot-long new structure has recently been found at the third trench of the Keeladi excavation after ASI ruled out the possibility of any noteworthy discovery at the site. The bricks used in this new structure are identical in design and make to those used in other parts.

“The bricks used in this new structure are identical in design and make to those used in other parts of Keeladi, strengthening the authenticity of the findings. Earlier studies by Amarnath Ramakrishna’s team had already suggested the area might have housed industrial zones,” V Marappan, Professor of History at Presidency College, outlined while talking to The Federal.

He added, “These new findings raise questions about whether other sections of the site remain unexcavated underground.” The new structure, east-west orientated was discovered 90 centimetres below the surface on the western side. Its length is estimated to be approximately 10 meters. According to archaeologists, it might have been an industrial building or a workshop.

Madras High Court intervenes

The matter made its way to the judiciary in the interim. Judges from the Madras High Court intervened and travelled to the excavation site. They asked the ASI to carry on with the excavations and permit the involvement of the Tamil Nadu Department of Archaeology. The archaeology department of the state followed the instruction.

It had been working on it since the third phase of excavation, giving a more dramatic turn to the events. The court’s Madurai bench in 2019 pronounced that the excavations should not stop since significant advancements in Tamil civilisation had been uncovered while considering a number of petitions that sought an order to the state and the centre to preserve the archaeological sites in Tamil Nadu.

The public would learn more about Tamil civilisation through the archaeological excavations, thus Division Bench consisting of Justices D. Krishnakumar and R. Vijayakumar advised the relevant authorities to ensure that they were carried out without any obstacles.

The court even ordered the centre to send back Amarnath Ramakrishna to Tamil Nadu within 15 days to continue the excavations. Amarnath Ramakrishna, who had been moved back to the state, put forth his report on the first two stages of excavation in January 2023.

Last year, the High Court even sent a notice to the centre demanding the ASI to release the report that was provided following the first two stages of the excavations. The centre received notice regarding the petition filed by Madurai resident P. Prabhakar Pandian from the bench.

The state and the centre were also instructed to submit more counter-affidavits to several public interest litigation petitions concerning the excavations, in the same year. It ordered the authorities to present the rebuttal affidavits to the 2016 and 2017 petitions which had asked the relevant authorities for guidance on how to proceed with the excavations at Keeladi rather than shutting down the site.

One of the petitions asked the government to establish a “site museum” at Keeladi. Stalin opened a Rs 18.43 crore Keeladi museum in March 2023 on two acres.

The Madurai bench even granted the Archaeological Survey India’s request to relocate the artefacts from the excavation to its Dehradun lab for further scientific analysis, in 2016. It was instructed to notify the state’s archaeology commissioner prior to the move. The commissioner was told to record videos and take pictures of the items. The ASI was given directions to return the objects to Tamil Nadu and provide a report to the court.

Controversy erupts between the Centre, Tamil Nadu govt

The 982-page final report was given by Ramakrishna in January 2023, following preliminary and interim submissions in 2016 and 2017, respectively. It had been with the ASI for almost two and a half years and it wrote to Ramakrishna in May seeking a revision.

The Archaeological Survey of India raised concerns regarding the dating and profoundity of specific outcomes. It underscored that the evidence for the earliest period seemed to be quite early and stated that it needed further examination.

According to the letter, “the three periods require proper nomenclatures or re-orientation.” It remarked that the “8th century BCE to 5th century BCE for Period I requires concrete justification.” It also noted that “just mentioning depth for the available scientific dates is not enough but the layer number should also be marked for comparative consistency analysis.” The ASI also demanded that the manner in which dates were presented should also be amended.

However, Amarnath Ramakrishna refused to modify his results, maintaining that his research was sound from a scientific standpoint and supported by strict archaeological standards. He maintained that material culture, stratigraphic sequences and even Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) corroborated the report’s chronology.

A number of Tamil Nadu political groups, including the ruling-Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), the Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi and historian R. Balakrishnan, denounced the ASI’s move as an attempt to stifle Tamil culture. They accused that the failure to recognise Keeladi’s importance was motivated by politics.

On the other hand, Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, the Union Minister for Culture, stated that additional scientific research was necessary to validate Ramakrishnan’s conclusions because they lacked technical support. He asserted that a single finding could not alter the entire discourse and therefore, more data, outcomes and proofs were needed to be collected.

Shekhawat stated that Tamil Nadu is a vital part of India and that its history should be honoured using knowledge based on science rather than polarising opinions. He informed Stalin that the union government would not hesitate to publish any reports and would be delighted to support the state if the research was validated by science.

The union minister declared that more convincing evidence is required for the report to be accepted by the scientific community. He even questioned was the Tamil Nadu government had been reluctant to work with the centre on this matter due to which the conflict has persisted.

“People holding such positions are trying to use that to grow regional sentiments. That is not fair. We have to be very cautious. Let archaeologists, historians, and technical experts discuss this, instead of politicians,” he mentioned.

However, Thangam Thennarasu, Tamil Nadu’s Archaeology Minister, charged that the union government treats Tamils as second-class citizens. He complained, “They also refused to allocate funds for the excavations and allowed the report to gather dust for two years. Now they say there is no adequate evidence. Every time they reject Tamil history, only the method of rejection changes.”

Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam’s (MDMK) Vaiko also claimed that the centre was attempting to promote “a non-existent Sanskrit civilisation” while repressing Tamil civilisation.

“How many obstacles do Tamils face? We have been fighting against all of them for thousands of years, and with the help of science, we have been establishing the antiquity of our race. Yet some minds refuse to accept it. It’s not the statements that need to be corrected, it’s some minds,” MK Stalin recently shared on social media last month while reacting on Ramakrishna’s recent transfer.

Communist Party of India (Marxist) MP from Madurai S Venkatesan expressed, “Transferring an official is not in itself a major issue, it is part of administrative procedures. But Amarnath Ramakrishna worked on the Keeladi excavation for eight years, without compromising on the truth. He was removed, reassigned and denied the opportunity to publish his findings. Only after court intervention was he allowed to write the report.”

He conveyed that the ASI had promised the court and Parliament that the report would be released in 11 months, but that deadline had not been fulfilled while the centre now wants more scientific proof at the final stage. “The message is clear: If you do not align with our views, this is what will be done to you. This is not just about an individual, it’s a discriminatory act against Tamil Nadu and against South Indian history itself,” he alleged.

The AIADMK (All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam) which was in power when the Keeladi report was issued, did not comment on the dispute for a long time. On 18th June, however, its senior leader and former minister RB Udhayakumar stated that the union government had requested further data in order to provide “additional corroboration.” He added that his party would be the first one to voice its disapproval if the Keeladi report was rejected.

Stalin accused the party of remaining silent while the centre minimised the importance of the location to which Udhayakumar retorted that his party’s government had approved Rs 55 lakh for the 2018 excavations. Mafoi Pandiarajan, a senior AIADMK leader who helmed archaeology under Edappadi Palaniswamy, praised him as “Keeladi Nayakar” (hero of Keeladi) and gave him credit for proving Tamil antiquity. A veteran DMK leader retaliated, “Their belated pride in Keeladi rings hollow when they put alliance politics above Tamil identity.”

Central government demands excavation report

The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has asked retired superintending archaeologist PS Sriraman to present the official excavation report for the third phase of the Keeladi excavations. He handled the short-lived third phase in 2017 after Ramakrishna’s abrupt transfer and reported that no major discoveries were made.

He retired in 2019 and has been given permission by the agency to write reports on the excavations he supervised in Keeladi, where he headed the third phase of excavations. He was also involved in the work for one season at Kodumanal which is situated on the northern banks of the Noyyal River in the Erode district, between 2017-2018.

According to archaeologists, Kodumanal could be split into two cultural periods: the Megalithic era and the Prehistoric era. During these times, the locals built durable structures, were skilled craftspeople and engaged in trade with several nations.

Sriraman would be writing the report from the ASI office in Chennai. He talked to The Hindu and revealed, “As I had retired, both reports were pending. I sought the approval of the ASI to access the material and prepare the reports. Since all the related materials are in Chennai, I will begin preparing the reports soon.”

He reiterated, “I have sought permission to complete the report since I am retired now. A formal communication from the ASI is expected soon,” while speaking with Deccan Herald. “The ASI instructed me to complete as quickly as possible. I am concentrating more on Kodumanal because it is an individual work – my work while the third phase in Keezhadi is for a shorter period and it was a continuation of work done earlier,” he asserted in conversation with The New Indian Express.

This comes more than a month after Ramakrishna was asked by the ASI to “resubmit” his report following the necessary changes recommended by two experts who reviewed it.

New dawn in India’s history: Traces of parallel civilization

The Keeladi site has unveiled a pivotal chapter in the history of Tamil Nadu. The indication that an artifact belonged to the 6th century BCE by the US laboratory Beta Analytics holds a major significance. They used the method of radiocarbon dating and suggested that it was contemporary with the urbanisation of the Gangetic plains.

The oldest of the 29 radiocarbon samples dated by the Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology since the 2017-18 excavation season was 580 BCE and the most recent was 200 CE. The results indicated that between the sixth century BCE and the second century CE, there was a vibrant urban and industrial civilisation that lasted for 800 years.

Large brick buildings from the Sangam Age had been discovered and provided proof of the development discussed in Sangam literature. Archaeologist K Rajan who is advisor to Tamil Nadu’s archaeology department voiced, “Most samples above the brick structures date to after the 3rd century BCE, while those below go as far back as the 6th century BCE,” reported The Times of India.

With the use of 3D technology and anthropometric measurements from a skull discovered at the Kondagai burial site, archaeologists are one step closer to unveiling the face of the ancient Tamil people who inhabited the Keeladi settlement thousands of years ago. Rajan stated, “Based on the skull, we will reconstruct the age, dietary pattern, determine the gender, and actual face of the person.”

He added, “This places Keeladi alongside the urbanisation of the Gangetic plains, India’s second urbanisation. Of the 29 radiocarbon dates, 12 fall in the pre-Ashokan era, before the 3rd century BCE.”

Over 20 research institutions from India and abroad are working with the state archaeology department to recreate life in Keeladi in 580 BCE. These involve Liverpool University in the United Kingdom, the University of Pisa in Italy, the Field Museum in Chicago, the French Institute of Pondicherry, IIT Gandhinagar and Deccan College.

Animal bones discovered in Keeladi are under examination at the Deccan College. The bones of bulls, buffaloes, goats, cows, sheep, dogs, pigs, antelope and spotted deer were located during excavations. Researchers at Madurai Kamaraj University are looking into ancient animal and human DNA in order to gain further insight into the mixing and human migration of the ancient residents of Keeladi and Kondagai, a Keeladi cluster hamlet.

A single site has produced 29 dates applying this scientific method. “It shows Keeladi was an urban settlement with a literate society and a community of artisans. It was an industrial hub along an ancient trade route linking the east coast port of Alagankulam to Muziris on the west coast via Madurai,” mentioned R Sivanandam, joint director of state archaeology department.

However, the settlement’s original name is still unknown. Towns, streets, palace structures, decorations, gemstones and international trade are part of Sangam literature. “Keeladi has proved that Sangam literature was a lived experience of ancient Tamils and not imaginative stories,” conveyed indologist R Balakrishnan.

At the site, archaeologists uncovered rectangular and cubic pieces of clay and ivory dice that, according to Balakrishnan, are referenced in “Kalithogai” the sixth of the eight anthologies of Sangam literature.

Rajan emphasised, “Keeladi isn’t the only site with roots in the 6th century BCE. Kodumanal, Porunthal, Sivagalai, Adichanallur and Korkai have also yielded dates from that period. Korkai has produced a date as early as 785 BCE, suggesting Sangam-age urbanisation was widespread.”

Only 4% of the 110 acres of cultural deposit at Keeladi have been unearthed by researchers in ten seasons of excavation. The state government intends to execute further excavations and has established a museum to display the discoveries. There are also plans for an on-site museum which will be the first of its sort in the country.

“Tamil Nadu has endured archaeological apathy for far too long until Keeladi sparked a wave of interest among Tamils,” complained Balakrishnan. Rajan expressed, “Keeladi is the first site that transformed the understanding of archaeology in Tamil Nadu.”

Faces from Keeladi

Meanwhile, a first-of-its-kind forensic facial reconstruction project coordinated by experts from Madurai Kamaraj University and Liverpool John Moores University restored the faces of two individuals who lived in the Keeladi region more than 2,500 years ago. Researchers described the facial features as South Indian with signs of ancient Austro-Asiatic people and West Eurasian (Iranian) hunter-gatherers.

The skulls were discovered around 800 meters from the main excavation site at Kondagai, a burial site. They added that more DNA research is required to identify the genetic ancestry.

Professor Caroline Wilkinson, director of Face Lab at Liverpool John Moores University informed, “We used a computer-assisted 3D facial reconstruction system to rebuild the facial musculature and estimate facial features following anatomical and anthropometrical standards. . As the lower jaws of the skulls were missing, we used orthodontic standards to estimate the shapes of the mandibles from cranial measurements and planes,” according to a report in The Times of India.

According to professor G Kumaresan of Madurai Kamaraj University’s genetics department which scanned and sent pictures of the skulls to Liverpool, “It is 80% science and 20% art.” He outlined that the DNA information and the recreated faces could be useful in determining the lineage of Tamils who lived during the Sangam era.

Critical moment in India’s civilisational journey

The 90-by-60-meter excavated area contains artefacts like as dice, unidentified copper coins, glass, shell, ivory, pearl, and terracotta beads, seals and gold decorations. More importantly, it is one of the few locations in Tamil Nadu, along with Arikamedu, Kaveripattinam and Korkai, to produce a broad range of structures, including intricate brick constructions, tank-like drainage systems, double-walled furnaces and terracotta ring wells.

All of this not only indicates a vibrant, literate and successful urbanized community but also emphasizes the advanced nature of Indian civilization. Its origins trace back to the timeline of the Gangetic plains which also illuminate how India has been home to not just one but multiple prime civilizations and flourishing communities residing in both the northern and southern regions of this vast country for many centuries. Furthermore, the discoveries indicated that they were also linked to the external world.

Such developments not only reinforce the deep civilizational roots of this ancient country but also aid in comprehending the elements of our age-old society. The myths surrounding foreigners who landed in the country and established their communities are also debunked by these revelations, which confirm that the nation has been the cradle of multiple ancient advanced settlements displaying city planning, trade, leisure and all indications of a vibrant cultural society.

These discoveries are therefore not merely a matter of pride but are crucial in preserving our civilizational foundations, comprehending and sustaining a continuous connection with our past, as well as understanding our background. Certainly, the sophisticated perspective of our forebears and the societies they formed and preserved over centuries is truly a subject of admiration.

Intellectuals, historians, epigraphists, geologists and archaeology aficionados have all been drawn to Keeladi to analyse the historical relevance it provides to society and it has even prompted several research investigations.

OpIndia,23/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/naga-organisations-in-manipur-object-to-india-myanmar-border-fencing-demand-restoration-of-fmr/,"Naga organisations in Manipur object to India-Myanmar border fencing, demand restoration of FMR: Read how this open border has been fuelling violence and narcotics...","In a significant step towards protecting the border of the nation, India has stepped up to work on fencing the long 1,643 km porous border with Myanmar. The Border Roads Organisation (BRO) will complete this project in phases over the next decade.

Over Rs 20,000 crore will be spent on the fence itself, and an additional Rs 11,000 crore on the construction of over 60 border roads, which will take place in this ambitious project. For the effective management of the India-Myanmar border, as well as ensuring the fencing in the north-east region, over 1,500 km of fencing, which includes 300 km of electric fencing, will be deployed.

Due to the ongoing ethnic violence between the Kuki-Zo and Meitei communities for a long time, and the signs of no normalcy in the specific region of Manipur have led to come up with this action has been taken. The violence has led to the deaths of over 250 people in total in the region.

The security has discovered that over 60,000 people have been displaced internally, and less than half of the around 6,000 weapons looted in the state. The vulnerable condition in the state amid the fighting between the military and armed opposition subsequent to the coup in February 2021, has also led to over 31,000 people fleeing and seeking refuge in India.

“Myanmar’s ongoing instability has further aggravated the situation, with a surge in smuggling, human trafficking, and movement of armed infiltrators. Drugs worth Rs 1,125 crore, for instance, have been seized along the border in the last six-seven months,” a source said.

Communities in other states like Manipur, Mizoram, and Arunachal Pradesh, which shared their boundaries with Myanmar, have opposed the proposal of a fence system. They also have shown opposition to the scrapping of the Free Movement Regime (FMR). The FMR allowed people residing along the border to venture 16 km into each other’s territory without such visas, earlier this year. Apex Kuki bodies, for instance, say the twin steps “threaten to infringe upon the cultural, traditional and historical rights of indigenous communities”.

Some critics argue that the expensive fencing initiative could create difficulties for communities with shared ethnic and cultural ties across the border, potentially disrupting connectivity, trade, and interpersonal relationships.

However, defence and security officials maintain that the fence is not meant to block civilian movement or break cultural and familial bonds between people on either side. “Plans are underway to install a network of gates equipped with biometric systems along the fence to enable cross-border movement while maintaining security,” said another source. These access points will be established in coordination with local communities.

The primary goal of the fence is to control the movement of armed groups and prevent smuggling of weapons, drugs, human trafficking, and illegal immigration, the source added. The successful completion of a 10-km stretch of fencing in Moreh, Manipur, is being cited as evidence of the project’s effectiveness in enhancing both security and trade regulation. “This initiative will also help streamline legal trade activities, bringing economic benefits to local populations while curbing the negative effects of illicit trade,” he said.

Several Naga organisations in Manipur, which include the United Naga Council, All Naga Students Association, Naga Women’s Union, and Naga People’s Movement for Human Rights South, submitted the petition through the Manipur governor through Ajay Kumar Bhalla. In fact, they urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah to halt the fencing of the India-Myanmar border and to restore the free movement regime (FMR) within twenty days.

The Naga civil organisation has set several forms of protest, “including picketing of government offices in Naga-inhabited areas have been undertaken along with protest rallies in Naga-inhabited hill districts, in the way to express a strong resentment against the abrogation of the FMR and the ongoing border fencing construction along the Indo-Myanmar border.

Previously, border tension has been witnessed, which has included conflict and clashes between the two communities. Last year, in July 2023, the heavily armed militants started to set buildings on fire. Soon, the uprising was settled by the state police after the people were cleared. Kuki militants arrived and opened fire.

The incident saw extensive looting and arson, and many private dwellings, including that of a journalist, were set on fire. The place was reportedly given to the people of the Meitei community who had escaped the area due to previous violence.

It was assumed that the attack was caused by the neighbouring country, Myanmar, formerly known as Burma. The probe was launched, which held four to five people for interrogation.

More than 700 illegal immigrants have reportedly entered from Myanmar on the Indian side and orders have been given to deport them. “Now, there are illegal migrants from Myanmar. 718 of them that the Assam Rifles have informed the Chandel Police and the Manipur Police. They have said that 718 fresh illegal migrants from Myanmar have come. The Manipur government has asked the Assam Rifles to deport them. This is a separate development,” unveiled Wasbir Hussain, a senior journalist.

He further continued, “On the other side of Moreh is the Burmese town of Tamu that is connected by an India-Myanmar friendship bridge and where Indians and Myanmarese can come and go within a distance of about 10 to 20 kilometres. There are no real documents necessary. Just an entry at the gate. You are allowed to go inside Tamu and come back. This is the situation in the border town.”

“There are a lot of Tamils in Moreh. There are a lot of Kukis. There are a lot of Meiteis of course. The Meities were attacked during the first wave of violence and they fled the town. They are in the relief camps in the Imphal Valley,” he mentioned.

Some north eastern state that share boundaries with Myanmar, like Mizoram, was also seen as an emerging major route for drug trafficking from Myanmar.

As a result of their influence, SB Krishna transformed into Ayesha. This case showcases how a girl was trapped in the conversion network linked to Agra.

According to media reports, Ayesha established multiple WhatsApp groups to solicit funds and maintained contact with prominent individuals through these channels. She also received assistance from the gang leader Abdul Rehman who was apprehended in Delhi. Several revelations about her have surfaced during police inquiry.

Kashmiri students facilitated the conversion of a Hindu girl from Goa

Ayesha hails from Goa and she was known as SB Krishna prior to her conversion. She enrolled at Panjab University to pursue an MSc in Data Science in 2020. During her time there, she was befriended by several students from Kashmir. They brainswashed her and highlighted the advantages of performing Namaz and donning a burqa. Over time, she began to be swayed by these manipulative ideas.

Subsequently, the students accompanied Krishna to Kashmir and she stayed with them for several days. Meanwhile, her parents were oblivious to this situation. The family members lodged a report in Delhi concerning their daughter’s disappearance. After many days, returned to Delhi alone as she did not like the valley.

Her family then took her to Goa and confiscated her mobile phone. As a result, she lost touch with all her friends and some persons connected to the conversion gang that she was acquainted with at that time. However, after six months, she escaped again and headed to Kolkata where she became Muslim and adopted the name Ayesha.

Her involvement with the group commenced in Kolkata where she started fundraising for conversion activities and utilized them for this nefarious purpose.

6 individuals who were formerly Hindus were part of the gang

Similar to Ayesha, five other accused joined the gang after their conversion. The police nabbed them from different states. Mohammad Ali, who was arrested in Jaipur, was formerly known as Piyush Pawar. He converted to Islam after developing a romantic relationship with a Muslim woman in order to marry her.

However, she left him after some time. Afterward, he married another Muslim girl from Bareilly. He became affiliated with the outlawed Popular Front of India (PFI) organization through the assistance of Kaleem Siddiqui. He began teaching religious studies in Kolkata as he was associated the jihadi organization. He met Ayesha there and received financial support from her to initiate conversion activities.

Another accused, Mohammad Ibrahim previously known as Reeth Banik, arranged for the arrival of two sisters from Agra to Kolkata. The gang leader, Abdul Rehman, who resided in Firozabad also converted to Islam. He was known as Mahendra Pal Jadoun before his conversion.

Kaleem Siddiqui operated the gang

Abdul Rehman, who has been taken into custody by the police in Delhi’s Mustafabad was known to be the one managing the conversion gang. However, a shocking truth was unveiled during the interrogation. It was uncovered that Maulana (Muslim cleric) Kaleem Siddiqui, who is serving a life sentence in prison is the brains behind the operation and Rehman worked for him.

Uttar Pradesh Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) arrested the former in a mass conversion case in 2021. He along with eleven accomplices was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2024 and has been carrying out his activities through Rehman since then.

Agra girl was prepared to become a Mujahida

Two siblings from Agra, who were rescued from Kolkata were converted and indoctrinated similar to that of Salafi Muslims. One of the sisters was so profoundly impacted that she even became a Mujahida (female jihadi), indicating her readiness to sacrifice her life. She expressed a desire not to return home even after their rescue.

Simultaneously, Mohammad Ibrahim informed the police that Hindu girls were subjected to tales about the Mughal rule. They were shown videos depicting Muslim rulers governing India which not only led to their conversion but also made them willing to sacrifice themselves. As per media reports, the authorities have retrieved several videos from the phone of Ayesha, who converted the sisters.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi is seen inaugurating the Ram Mandir, accompanied by a voiceover from an Islamic fundamentalist declaring, “Enough temples have been constructed in Somnath, now they should be demolished,” in one of the clips.

Meanwhile, the police reported that the sisters were wearing hijabs when they arrived to save them. How, they hid and refused to return, claiming to have discovered their purpose. The female officers counseled the sisters and they were safely returned to Agra. The cops even discovered images featuring an AK-47 on the social media accounts of one of the girls.

The investigating agency suspects that the sisters might have been involved in an Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS)-module. Extensive conversations have also been disclosed with Abdul Rehman on social media. The sisters were being indoctrinated to die and kill in the name of Islam. All of these conversations have been documented in the case file being compiled against the culprits. The police are actively investigating the matter and are working to identify the victims.",hindu girl goa arrived panjab university pursue study kashmiri student persuaded embrace islam result influence sb krishna transformed ayesha case showcase girl trapped conversion network linked agra according medium report ayesha established multiple whatsapp group solicit fund maintained contact prominent individual channel also received assistance gang leader abdul rehman apprehended delhi several revelation surfaced police inquiry kashmiri student facilitated conversion hindu girl goa ayesha hail goa known sb krishna prior conversion enrolled panjab university pursue msc data science 2020 time befriended several student kashmir brainswashed highlighted advantage performing namaz donning burqa time began swayed manipulative idea subsequently student accompanied krishna kashmir stayed several day meanwhile parent oblivious situation family member lodged report delhi concerning daughter’s disappearance many day returned delhi alone like valley family took goa confiscated mobile phone result lost touch friend person connected conversion gang acquainted time however six month escaped headed kolkata became muslim adopted name ayesha involvement group commenced kolkata started fundraising conversion activity utilized nefarious purpose 6 individual formerly hindu part gang similar ayesha five accused joined gang conversion police nabbed different state mohammad ali arrested jaipur formerly known piyush pawar converted islam developing romantic relationship muslim woman order marry however left time afterward married another muslim girl bareilly became affiliated outlawed popular front india pfi organization assistance kaleem siddiqui began teaching religious study kolkata associated jihadi organization met ayesha received financial support initiate conversion activity another accused mohammad ibrahim previously known reeth banik arranged arrival two sister agra kolkata gang leader abdul rehman resided firozabad also converted islam known mahendra pal jadoun conversion kaleem siddiqui operated gang abdul rehman taken custody police delhi’s mustafabad known one managing conversion gang however shocking truth unveiled interrogation uncovered maulana muslim cleric kaleem siddiqui serving life sentence prison brain behind operation rehman worked uttar pradesh anti terrorism squad at arrested former mass conversion case 2021 along eleven accomplice sentenced life imprisonment 2024 carrying activity rehman since agra girl prepared become mujahida two sibling agra rescued kolkata converted indoctrinated similar salafi muslim one sister profoundly impacted even became mujahida female jihadi indicating readiness sacrifice life expressed desire return home even rescue simultaneously mohammad ibrahim informed police hindu girl subjected tale mughal rule shown video depicting muslim ruler governing india led conversion also made willing sacrifice per medium report authority retrieved several video phone ayesha converted sister prime minister narendra modi seen inaugurating ram mandir accompanied voiceover islamic fundamentalist declaring “enough temple constructed somnath demolished ” one clip meanwhile police reported sister wearing hijab arrived save hid refused return claiming discovered purpose female officer counseled sister safely returned agra cop even discovered image featuring ak 47 social medium account one girl investigating agency suspect sister might involved islamic state iraq syria isi module extensive conversation also disclosed abdul rehman social medium sister indoctrinated die kill name islam conversation documented case file compiled culprit police actively investigating matter working identify victim

The police had also rescued a Dalit Hindu girl named Mamta from Haryana, who had been brought there for conversion. Now, the girl rescued girl has become a government witness in the case.

The UP ATS and the police are tracing one Junaid, a member of the same Islamic conversion racket based on the information provided by the rescued Dalit Hindu girl.

In the police investigation, the connection of Shaheen Bagh, which was the hotspot of anti-CAA protests in 2019, has also come to the fore in the present case. During interrogation, the girl told the investigators, “I was being brainwashed. They kept me in a hostel in Shaheen Bagh, Delhi. Abdul Rehman Qureshi took me to his house, converted me there and got me married to Junaid. Then they were preparing to send me to Kolkata.”

She added that there were many girls in that hostel, however, only those girls who refused to convert to Islam were raped.

On being asked about accused Junaid and how she came in contact with him, the Dalit Hindu girl said, “In 2019, I became friends with Junaid from Delhi on Facebook. Slowly I started sharing my problems with him. My father works in a factory and the financial condition of the house is not very strong. Junaid used to insist on meeting me, but I did not go to meet him.”

She added that in November 2024, her wedding was fixed and when she informed Junaid about this, the accused allegedly began pressuring her to leave everything for the sake of Allah and come to him.

“I left home 12 days before the wedding after being influenced by Junaid’s words and came to Delhi. Junaid made me stay in a hostel in Shaheen Bagh. A Maulana came there and started telling me about Islam. He said that there is nothing in Hinduism. Then a girl was sent to me. She showed me some Islamic videos,” the girl told the authorities.

When asked about how the conversion to Islam happened, the girl said that Junaid took her to main accused Abdul Rehman, who asked several questions to analyse the extent of brainwashing she had been subjected to.

The girl said that Junaid would not allow her to establish any contact with her family and that she was converted to Islam and had Nikah with Junaid in April 2025. The two, however, did not stay together as per Abdul Rehman’s instructions.

After conversion to Islam, the Dalit Hindu girl’s name was changed to Shifa. It has emerged that Junaid is already married, has a child, and that the Hindu victim was aware of this. Abdul Rehman had told her that everything is permissible in his religion.

When the police questioned about other girls in Shaheen Bagh, the girl said, “I was kept in a hostel in Shaheen Bagh, Delhi for a long time. There were other girls in that hostel. No one is allowed to talk to anyone. All day long, my mind was poisoned against Hinduism. Muslim girls surrounded me and told me the supposed virtues of Islam. This was the daily routine there. All this goes on until you surrender yourself to Islam.”

She added that the Muslim girls brainwashing non-Muslim girls used to tell that Qayamat (Doomsday) will come. Everything will be ruined. “A mountain of troubles will fall on my family. I used to get scared on hearing all this,” she said.

Meanwhile, the Agra Police has deployed a team to Delhi to arrest Junaid. The police said that Junaid used to trap young Hindu girls, especially from poor families, on Facebook and lured them to convert to Islam. The police said that these newly-converted Hindu girls were to be trained as Mujahida(s) or female Jihadis.

ISIS-style Islamic conversion racket exposed in Agra

After busting a massive Islamic conversion racket in Balrampur, the Uttar Pradesh Anti-Terrorist Squad, exposed a large-scale Islamic religious conversion and radicalisation syndicate that operated with tactics mirroring those of the ISIS rooted in Agra.

The racket, which spanned across six Indian states, involved terror funding through the dark web and targeted vulnerable Hindu women and minors through coercion, deception, and ‘love jihad’. The ATS’s operation led to the arrest of ten individuals from Delhi, Goa, West Bengal, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, and Uttar Pradesh.

As reported earlier, the 10 accused arrested by the Agra Police from Delhi, Goa, West Bengal, Uttarakhand, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh, have been identified as Aisha alias S.B. Krishna (Kolkata, West Bengal), Osama (Kolkata, West Bengal), Rehman Qureshi (Agra, UP), Abbu Tariq (Muzaffarnagar, UP), Abdur Rehman (Dehradun, Uttarakhand), Mohammad Ali (Jaipur, Rajasthan), Junaid Qureshi (Jaipur Rajasthan), Mustafa alias Manoj (Delhi), and Mohammad Ali (Jaipur, Rajasthan).

The accused have been booked under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (Sections 87, 111(3), and 111(4)) and the UP Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Act, 2021.

On 21st July 2025, the Anti-Terrorism Squad and the Intelligence Bureau (IB) arrested mastermind Abdul Rehman from the Mustafabad area of Delhi. Abdul Rehman, originally from Firozabad, was earlier a Hindu named Mahendra Pal. He had converted to Christianity first, and later converted to Islam. His involvement in the racket was reportedly inspired by jailed cleric Kaleem Siddiqui, who is currently serving a life sentence for running a similar conversion network.

During questioning, the accused persons who are mostly Hindus converted to Islam, said that they were taught that converting others was the only way to attain heaven, or “jannat,” and they began to actively target vulnerable people, calling it “adding new relations.”

Two sisters had gone missing from Agra’s Sadar Bazar area. One of the sister’s photo with an AK-47 was shared on social media which prompted the investigation. During questioning, the girls told the police they were willing to return home, but only on the condition that the arrested accused be released. According to them, those arrested had done nothing wrong and were only “serving religion.” The sisters claimed that if the accused remained in jail, none of them would go to heaven.

Mission Asmita: Coordinated crackdown on conversion syndicates

The entire operation is part of Mission Asmita, a state-wide campaign initiated by the UP Government to eliminate threats to national security stemming from foreign-funded religious conversions, radicalisation, and communal subversion.

As DGP Krishna confirmed, coordination with national agencies is ongoing, and custodial remand for the accused will be sought to unravel the full scope of the conspiracy. Specialised agencies including the ATS and STF have been roped in due to the terror-linked nature of the case.",agra islamic conversion racket case involving conversion two hindu sister islam shocking revelation made anti terrorism squad at intelligence bureau ib arrested mastermind abdul rehman mustafabad area delhi police also rescued dalit hindu girl named mamta haryana brought conversion girl rescued girl become government witness case at police tracing one junaid member islamic conversion racket based information provided rescued dalit hindu girl police investigation connection shaheen bagh hotspot anti caa protest 2019 also come fore present case interrogation girl told investigator “i brainwashed kept hostel shaheen bagh delhi abdul rehman qureshi took house converted got married junaid preparing send kolkata ” added many girl hostel however girl refused convert islam raped asked accused junaid came contact dalit hindu girl said “in 2019 became friend junaid delhi facebook slowly started sharing problem father work factory financial condition house strong junaid used insist meeting go meet ” added november 2024 wedding fixed informed junaid accused allegedly began pressuring leave everything sake allah come “i left home 12 day wedding influenced junaid’s word came delhi junaid made stay hostel shaheen bagh maulana came started telling islam said nothing hinduism girl sent showed islamic video ” girl told authority asked conversion islam happened girl said junaid took main accused abdul rehman asked several question analyse extent brainwashing subjected girl said junaid would allow establish contact family converted islam nikah junaid april 2025 two however stay together per abdul rehman’s instruction conversion islam dalit hindu girl’s name changed shifa emerged junaid already married child hindu victim aware abdul rehman told everything permissible religion police questioned girl shaheen bagh girl said “i kept hostel shaheen bagh delhi long time girl hostel one allowed talk anyone day long mind poisoned hinduism muslim girl surrounded told supposed virtue islam daily routine go surrender islam ” added muslim girl brainwashing non muslim girl used tell qayamat doomsday come everything ruined “a mountain trouble fall family used get scared hearing ” said meanwhile agra police deployed team delhi arrest junaid police said junaid used trap young hindu girl especially poor family facebook lured convert islam police said newly converted hindu girl trained mujahida female jihadis isi style islamic conversion racket exposed agra busting massive islamic conversion racket balrampur uttar pradesh anti terrorist squad exposed large scale islamic religious conversion radicalisation syndicate operated tactic mirroring isi rooted agra racket spanned across six indian state involved terror funding dark web targeted vulnerable hindu woman minor coercion deception ‘love jihad’ ats’s operation led arrest ten individual delhi goa west bengal rajasthan uttarakhand uttar pradesh reported earlier 10 accused arrested agra police delhi goa west bengal uttarakhand rajasthan uttar pradesh identified aisha alias b krishna kolkata west bengal osama kolkata west bengal rehman qureshi agra abbu tariq muzaffarnagar abdur rehman dehradun uttarakhand mohammad ali jaipur rajasthan junaid qureshi jaipur rajasthan mustafa alias manoj delhi mohammad ali jaipur rajasthan accused booked bharatiya nyaya sanhita section 87 111 3 111 4 prohibition unlawful conversion religion act 2021 21st july 2025 anti terrorism squad intelligence bureau ib arrested mastermind abdul rehman mustafabad area delhi abdul rehman originally firozabad earlier hindu named mahendra pal converted christianity first later converted islam involvement racket reportedly inspired jailed cleric kaleem siddiqui currently serving life sentence running similar conversion network questioning accused person mostly hindu converted islam said taught converting others way attain heaven “jannat ” began actively target vulnerable people calling “adding new relation ” two sister gone missing agra’s sadar bazar area one sister’s photo ak 47 shared social medium prompted investigation questioning girl told police willing return home condition arrested accused released according arrested done nothing wrong “serving religion ” sister claimed accused remained jail none would go heaven mission asmita coordinated crackdown conversion syndicate entire operation part mission asmita state wide campaign initiated government eliminate threat national security stemming foreign funded religious conversion radicalisation communal subversion dgp krishna confirmed coordination national agency ongoing custodial remand accused sought unravel full scope conspiracy specialised agency including at stf roped due terror linked nature case
OpIndia,23/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/cabinet-approves-india-uk-fta-pm-modi-to-sign-landmark-deal-during-his-visit-to-uk/,Union Cabinet approves India-UK FTA to be signed by PM Modi in London: Read how the landmark deal will benefit India,"The Union Cabinet approved the free trade agreement (FTA) between India and UK on Tuesday, 22nd July. The deal, officially called the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, is set to be signed on 24th July, in London during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s four-day visit to the United Kingdom and the Maldives.

India’s Minister of Commerce and Industry, Piyush Goyal, will be joining PM Modi for the important visit. Although the agreement was announced on 6th May, the full text was held back pending final legal review.

The FTA is a comprehensive trade pact involving goods, services, innovation, government procurement, and intellectual property rights. It will have to be ratified by the British Parliament after signing. For India, this is a giant step in global trade diplomacy.

The main goal of the pact is to eliminate or reduce customs duties on imports and exports between the two nations. This should make Indian products competitive in the UK and vice versa. Both nations desire to increase their trade to USD 120 billion by 2030.

Key benefits for India

With the FTA allowing the elimination of tariffs on 99% of Indian tariff lines, covering nearly 100% of trade value, and reducing tariffs on 90% of UK tariff lines, the agreement is expected to deliver an estimated annual economic boost of £4.8 billion (US$6.4 billion) for the UK by 2040. This will help major Indian sectors like textiles, leather, marine products, footwear, toys, sporting goods, engineering products, gems and jewellery, auto parts, and organic chemicals. Since most of these are labor-intensive sectors, the deal is expected to create a massive amount of employment in India.

The agreement is in line with India’s focus on local production and exports. The agreement gives Indian products better access to the British market and allows the creation of jobs especially critical for the country’s growing youth population.

Social security relief and professional mobility

The FTA also targets freer movement of professionals between both nations. Indian professionals in fields like IT, finance, engineering, teaching, yoga, and even chefs and musicians will have improved access to employment opportunities in the UK.

Another standalone agreement, the Double Contribution Convention (DCC), has also been finalised. This will prevent Indian workers in the UK from contributing twice to social security systems for a period of up to three years. This will prevent Indian professionals who temporarily work in the UK from contributing to both the Indian and the UK systems. The savings thereby generated will be beneficial to both the workers and the employers.

Benefits for consumers

Both countries’ consumers will gain the advantage of lower prices and diversity of products. Indian consumers, for instance, will soon have lower chemists’ products, tea, and electrical items from the UK. UK consumers will get improved deals in terms of Indian apparel, seafood, and leather items.

The trade agreement also includes digital commerce and simplification of customs commitments, which will make trade easier and faster for businesses.

Sectors to monitor

Advanced manufacturing, automotive, beverages, clean energy, and life sciences will benefit in the UK. In India, there will be substantial gains in the textiles, leather, agriculture, and IT services industries. There will also be stronger supply chains and employment generation for both economies.

India’s exports to the UK rose by 12.6 per cent to USD 14.5 billion, while imports grew by 2.3 per cent to USD 8.6 billion in 2024-25.

Sohail Shaikh alias Badshah (30), Ayodhya Prasad Chouhan (48) and mastermind Farooq Ahmad Malik (40) have been captured while the hunt is on for Arbaz and Sajid.

The accused reportedly developed the plan 25 days prior to the crime, which was carried out on 11th July at 12:15 pm. Farooq was nabbed from Mumbai and the other two were taken into custody from West Bengal. The incident transpired in Karnataka’s Kalaburagi.

Notably, the daytime robbery case was resolved when the culprit was apprehended with the assistance of a Pav Bhaji that Farooq had paid via a digital wallet. Four burglars armed with guns and knives as well as wearing masks stormed into Marthula (Sibghatullah per other reports) Malik’s gold jewellery store. After tying a rope around his hands and feet, they opened the locker and stole money and three kilogrammes of gold ornaments.

The owner of the store, however, told the authorities that just 805 g of gold had disappeared to conceal the undisclosed gold he had in his store. Five squads of police were assembled to apprehend them. Over the past ten days, they went to various districts in West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra. According to an officer, the police first began tracking the accused using CCTV footage gathered from the area, reported The Indian Express.

He informed, “Before the robbery, the accused came to the spot and had a last-minute discussion. Farooq was also present. After they left for the shop, Farooq bought a pav bhaji paying Rs 30 through Phone Pe. He was monitoring the robbery. The others returned after the robbery and fled the spot along with Farooq. We checked the payment made and got the contact number. We found that the number belonged to Farooq. It was a major lead.”

The cops stated that the perpetrators melted the gold ornaments, sold some of the precious metal and returned home. They had also discarded their cellphones before moving to their native places, however, police teams were already waiting for them. The official added, “We are looking for two more accused, named Arbaz and Sajid, in the case.”

According to the investigation, the culprits scared their victims during the heist using a lighter shaped like a gun. They then took a bus to Mumbai and split up. The police conveyed they were also looking into Marthula Malik after he later acknowledged that three kilogrammes of gold had been taken from his shop.

After a financial setback, Farooq, also a jeweller, teamed up with Prasad to plan a theft and invited him to participate. Furthermore, the latter recruited his accomplice, Sohail who is a tailor, in the crime and the two joined Farooq in the heist by travelling from Mumbai to Kalaburagi.",police arrested three member inter state gang retrieved 2 865 kg gold valued ₹2 10 crore ₹4 80 lakh cash robbery took place goldsmith’s store crowded saraf bazaar area 11th july sohail shaikh alias badshah 30 ayodhya prasad chouhan 48 mastermind farooq ahmad malik 40 captured hunt arbaz sajid accused reportedly developed plan 25 day prior crime carried 11th july 12 15 pm farooq nabbed mumbai two taken custody west bengal incident transpired karnataka’s kalaburagi notably daytime robbery case resolved culprit apprehended assistance pav bhaji farooq paid via digital wallet four burglar armed gun knife well wearing mask stormed marthula sibghatullah per report malik’s gold jewellery store tying rope around hand foot opened locker stole money three kilogrammes gold ornament owner store however told authority 805 g gold disappeared conceal undisclosed gold store five squad police assembled apprehend past ten day went various district west bengal uttar pradesh maharashtra according officer police first began tracking accused using cctv footage gathered area reported indian express informed “before robbery accused came spot last minute discussion farooq also present left shop farooq bought pav bhaji paying r 30 phone pe monitoring robbery others returned robbery fled spot along farooq checked payment made got contact number found number belonged farooq major lead ” cop stated perpetrator melted gold ornament sold precious metal returned home also discarded cellphone moving native place however police team already waiting official added “we looking two accused named arbaz sajid case ” according investigation culprit scared victim heist using lighter shaped like gun took bus mumbai split police conveyed also looking marthula malik later acknowledged three kilogrammes gold taken shop financial setback farooq also jeweller teamed prasad plan theft invited participate furthermore latter recruited accomplice sohail tailor crime two joined farooq heist travelling mumbai kalaburagi

Afterward, some lawmakers urged the government to provide the data on such cases in Goa.

They brought attention to the case of SB Krishna who was detained by the Uttar Pradesh police in Goa on suspicion of kidnapping two girls. They emphasised that a “international network funded by global operators” had been functioning in the region and questioned the government’s efforts to dismantle the “transnational network.”

Her involvement became known after a multi-state Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS)-style conversion racket with ties to Popular Front of India (PFI) and Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) was busted by the authorities. Krishna, also known as Ayesha and Nikki, left Hinduism to embarce Islam and was nabbed on suspicion of kidnapping two women for marriage.

Sawant conveyed, “Forced conversions are not allowed under the anti-conversion law in Uttar Pradesh. Many states have passed such laws. I believe we too need to bring such a law so that forced conversions will be disallowed,” and added, “All of you too need to support us,” turning to the legislators of the Congress party.

The CM asserted, “Inter-religion marriages are happening. That is their wish, but forced conversions by giving money should not be done.” According to CM Sawant, “love jihad” cases were also occurring in Goa. “There was denial about love jihad. If you want, I can give you details later,” he mentioned. “Now you may say they are adults, they are in love, but when there are cases of targeting, then we will have to pay attention,” the Chief minister highlighted.

Cruz Silva called for a comprehensive investigation into the case and demanded the state’s law enforcement agencies to look into the number of such accused people living there. “Goa is an international tourist destination. Tourists from across the country and abroad visit Goa. Recently, a grand Exposition of Saint Francis Xavier was held in Old Goa, attended by lakhs of people,” he pointed out.

“However, during the same period (this accused) was also staying in Old Goa and was linked to ISIS. Now that the Uttar Pradesh police have arrested her, everything has come to light. But how is it that the Goa Police and the Crime Branch had no information about her,” he asked.

“Goa’s harmony has never been disturbed and it should never be. I made it clear that this is against those who are attempting to do forced conversions. Inter-religious marriages are happening in Goa. That is their willingness, their wish. However, conversion should not take place by offering lures like money, etc.,” he noted.

Forced conversion racket exposed

Ten people from six states were apprehended by the Uttar Pradesh police for their roles in illegal religious conversions under “Mission Asmita.” Six of them were Hindus, including Krishna, who changed their religion after which they subsequently trapped others, especially young men and women, to follow suit.

The mastermind Abdul Rehman had also been captured from Delhi’s Mustafabad by Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) and the Intelligence Bureau (IB). The authorities have linked their network to the Islamic State (IS) and reported to have discovered the usage of foreign funds for radicalisation and religious conversions.

Additionally, the perpetrators were involved in various activities within the network, such as receiving and administering money, giving legal counsel, supplying new phones and SIM cards, trapping victims into love jihad and assisting in religious conversions.

Anti-conversion law in Indian states

Forced religious conversions are illegal or set to become unlawful in twelve Indian states including Arunachal Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh through “Freedom of Religion Acts.” These regulations forbid religious conversions through force, manipulation, deception or inducement. People who break the law are punished with fines and even incarceration.

Arunachal Pradesh

Nearly 46 years after the Arunachal Pradesh Freedom of Religion Act of 1978 was passed, the state government made the decision to impose it by creating regulations for its enactment, amid protests from the Christian organisations. The development transpired after the Gauhati High Court asked the state government to draft rules within 6 months, in September 2024, in response to an appeal.

October 1978 saw the passage of the act which “prohibits conversion from one religious faith to any other by use of force, inducement or by fraudulent means and for matters connected therewith.” It’s goal was to safeguard indigenous religions, beliefs and customs. The law unequivocally stated that anyone found in violation would face a maximum penalty of two years in prison and a fine of up to Rs 10,000.

Chhattisgarh

Vishnu Deo Sai, the chief minister of Chhattisgarh, also announced that his government would introduce a new, strict law to stop tribal people and possibly others from converting to other religion. He also argued that in order to stop proselytisation, tribal members should be delisted from the Scheduled Tribe category if they convert to another faith. According to earlier reports, the new law would be known as the Chhattisgarh Religious Freedom Act.

Illegal conversion of women, children and members of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes shall be criminalised under it. It would stipulate a minimum penalty of two years and a maximum penalty of ten years in jail with the possibility of a fine of at least Rs 25,000. Furthermore, if someone is found guilty of participating in unlawful mass conversion, they could be sentenced to 3-10 years in prison, alongside a fine of up to Rs 50,000. The victims would also be compensated up to Rs 5 lakh from the court.

Gujarat

Gujarat Freedom of Religion (Amendment) Bill 2021 was put forward by the government in an effort to mitigate the threat of forced religious conversion in the state. The Family Court or the court will consider it illegal to marry someone for the sole intent of converting them to another religion in accordance with the law. It also forbids anyone from directly or indirectly pressuring or misleading someone into marriage or assisting in marriage for conversion.

According to the law, anyone who commits the offence, provides assistance or recommends someone else to do it is equally guilty of committing the crime. A fine of at least Rs 2 lakhs and a sentence of 3 to 5 years in prison await those who breach these regulations. If the women belong to Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes, a fine of Rs 3 lakhs and a prison sentence of 4 to 7 years will be enforced.

Organisations that break these rules will have their registrations revoked and those found guilty could receive sentences ranging from three to ten years in prison as well as a Rs 5 lakh penalty. The provisions make grooming jihad a non-bailable crime.

Haryana

The Haryana Prevention of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Bill 2022 makes it illegal to convert someone to another religion “through misrepresentation, force, undue influence, coercion, allurement or by any fraudulent means or by marriage.” It specifies that such conversions are punishable by one to five years in prison and a fine of at least Rs 1 lakh. However, it offers an exception for those who return to their immediate prior religion, as this will not be considered a conversion.

According to the law, anyone who converts or attempts to convert a minor, a woman or a member of one of the Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes will be granted a minimum penalty of four years in prison with the possibility of an extension to ten years, as well as a fine of at least Rs 3 lakh. Moreover, it outlines that marriages entered into just for the purpose of transitioning from one faith to another will be considered invalid.

Himachal Pradesh

The purpose of the Himachal Pradesh Freedom of Religion (Amendment) Bill, 2022, was to amend the state’s current conversion statute. On 21st December 2020, the Himachal Pradesh Freedom of Religion Act 2019 was notified. It was passed with the intention of amending the 2006 conversion law, which the Himachal High Court halted in 2012 on the grounds that it violated religious freedom.

The proposed amendment raised the maximum sentence for forced conversion from seven years in prison to ten years. It also specified that a person who conceals their religion to wed someone of a different faith faces a minimum three-year sentence. A clause to increase this punishment to ten years is also included. Furthermore, the penalty has been increased to Rs 50,000 (Rs 50,000), with a likelihood of an increase to Rs 100,000 (Rs 1 lakh).

The law indicated that mass conversion will impose a maximum penalty of Rs 50,000 and seven years in prison. According to the legislation, it will be considered a crime if someone uses the resources offered by his original religion even after converting with two years in prison with the possibility of an extension to five years. Additionally, the penalty could increase from Rs 50,000 to Rs 1 lakh.

Jharkhand

The Jharkhand Dharma Swatantra Adhiniyam, commonly known as the Jharkhand Freedom of Religion Bill 2017, renders conversion by coercion, fraud and allurement illegal. A conviction can result in a fine of up to Rs 50,000 and/or a jail term of up to three years. If the target is a woman, a minor or a member of a scheduled caste or tribe, the penalty and fine increase. Furthermore, it specifies that the District Magistrate must give their prior consent before a person can change their faith.

Karnataka

Karnataka Protection of Right to Freedom of Religion Act, 2022 “provides for protection of right to freedom of religion and prohibition of unlawful conversion from one religion to another by misrepresentation, force, undue influence, coercion, allurement or by any fraudulent means.”

It also “prohibits conversion from one religion to another religion by misrepresentation, force, fraud, undue influence, coercion, allurement or by promise of marriage.” The penalty for breaking the law included a fine of Rs 25,000 and a three-year jail sentence which could be extended to five years.

The penalty was increased to ten years if the conversion involved a woman, a member of the Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe, a minor child or a person who was mentally unstable. However, in 2023, the Congress government of Chief Minister Siddaramaiah declared that it was going to abolish the law.

Madhya Pradesh

The Madhya Pradesh Freedom of Religion Act 2021 was created to curb the rising threat of grooming jihad by prohibiting religious conversion through deceptive ways. A marriage that is solemnised for the purpose of conversion will be considered void under the law. The offence will be cognisable, non-bailable, and subject to Sessions Court proceedings.

People who break the law face a minimum fine of Rs 25,000 and a maximum sentence of 1-5 years in prison. A victim who is minor or a member of a Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe will result in a heavier sentence for the perpetrator. The accused could be fined up to Rs 50,000 and imprisoned for 2-10 years.

Similarly, attempting to conceal one’s religion in order to dishonestly solemnise a marriage will result in a minimum fine of Rs 50,000 and three to ten years in prison. Those found to be involved in mass conversions will also face a fine of Rs 1 lakh and a jail sentence of five to ten years.

The law has some new specifications that apply to schools, churches and madrassas. According to the new provisions, the government could cease offering aid to an institution if it engages in or supports forced religious conversion or love jihad (grooming jihad). The government will also have the authority to take back any land that has been given to such an organisation under the proposed law.

Odisha

Notably, the first state to enact anti-conversion legislation was the Government of Odisha (formerly Orissa). “No one shall convert or attempt to convert, either directly or otherwise, any person from one religious faith to another by the use of force, by inducement, or by any fraudulent means,” according to the Orissa Freedom of Religion Act, 1967.

A year in prison, a Rs 5,000 fine, or both could be imposed for breaking the law which turned into a template for other states. The penalty could be doubled if the conversion involves a woman, a minor or a member of a Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe.

Moreover, the legislation requires that any conversion to another religion be reported to the appropriate authorities. According to the Orissa Freedom of Religion Rules 1989, the concerned religious priest must inform the concerned District Magistrates at least fifteen days prior to the ceremony’s date, time and location, as well as the names and addresses of the individuals who will be converted.

Rajasthan

According to the Rajasthan Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Bill 2025, anyone seeking to change their religion must apply to the district magistrate at least 60 days beforehand. Afterwars, the magistrate will determine if the conversion was coerced or voluntary. The conversion to a different faith may be permitted if the authorities conclude that no compulsion was applied during the process.

It highlighted that anyone found guilty of engaging in coercive religious conversion faces a sentence of two to ten years in prison. Additionally, a person convicted of forcibly attempting to convert women, children, members of Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes communities shall be fined Rs 25,000. Large-scale conversion will result in a fine of Rs 50,000 and three to ten years in jail.

Uttarakhand

The Dharm Swatantrata Adhiniyam also known as the Uttarakhand Freedom of Religion Act 2018, made forced and unlawful conversions a non-bailable crime. According to the law, anyone found engaging in such conduct faces a jail sentence ranging from one year to five years. The minimum jail sentence is two years if the victim is from the Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe communities.

A person who wishes to convert is required to provide an affidavit to the concerned District Magistrate one month in advance and state that the conversion is voluntary. Any conversions that are discovered to have violated the guidelines will be pronounced unlawful by the government. One must also submit the same document if they want to convert to get married.

Uttar Pradesh

The Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion (Amendment) Bill 2024, was introduced with changes to the anti-conversion law. According to the Uttar Pradesh government, the Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Act, 2021 were inadequate to tackle the menace.

The maximum penalty used to be 10 years in prison and a fine of up to Rs 50,000. However, following the amendments, the severity of the penalties for a number of offences involving religious conversion has been raised. Unlawful religious conversion is now a crime that carries a sentence of three to ten years in jail. Mass religious conversions and conversions financed by foreign sources will also result in penalties ranging from seven to fourteen years in prison.

Furthermore, it conveyed that penalties for religious conversion would vary from 20 years to life in prison if the victim’s life or fortune was threatened, in case force was used or if marriage or the promise of marriage was made for religious conversion. Additionally, incarceration can range from 20 years to life if a woman, minor or individual is lured and human trafficking takes place.

Conclusion

Now, it appears that BJP-ruled Goa is also drawing inspiration from the anti-conversion laws of these states, the majority of which enacted the law under the governance of the saffron party.

OpIndia,22/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/1-29-lakh-bigha-land-occupied-by-bangladeshi-infiltrators-and-doubtful-citizens-freed-in-4-years-informs-assam-cm-himanta-biswa-sarma/,"1.29 lakh bigha land occupied by Bangladeshi infiltrators and doubtful citizens freed in 4 years, informs Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma","Chief Minister of Assam, Himanta Biswa Sarma stated that around 29 lakh bighas (nearly 10 lakh acres) of land in Assam is reported to be occupied by “Bangladeshi infiltrators and doubtful citizens.” He mentioned that after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government took office in 2021, a campaign was initiated to reclaim the property but they encountered international pressure to cease these actions.

He made the shocking disclosures on 21st July during a function commemorating the fourth anniversary of the Multipurpose Agricultural Project at Garukhuti in the Darang district.

This project commenced in 2021, and to date, 77,420 bighas of land (25,500 acres) have been cleared of encroachments.

“Today, the land in Garukhuti, once occupied illegally, has been converted into productive agricultural fields. This is the model we aim to replicate across encroached areas in Assam,” he conveyed.

In the last 4 years, we have freed over 42,000 acres of land from encroachers and dedicated it to public use. pic.twitter.com/AaWDKMcNTK — Himanta Biswa Sarma (@himantabiswa) July 21, 2025

According to media reports, Sarma remarked, “After the successful execution of the campaign in the Darang district, the initiative was also extended to Borsola, Lumding, Burhapahar, Pabha, Batadrava, Chapar and Paikan. In the last four years, we have reclaimed 1.29 lakh bigha (around 43,000 acres) of occupied land. A considerable portion of it is now being allocated for forest development and the citizens of the state.”

He declared, “If anyone believes that after two or three campaigns we will be intimidated, not confront them directly and bow down, they are mistaken. The martyrs of the Assam Movement will certainly be avenged.” He mentioned that during the Assam Movement from 1983 to 1985, there was a prevailing sense of defeat and many individuals had “surrendered” to the Congress which changed the political trajectory of the state.

Shankar-Madhav became Shankar-Azan

Sarma pointed out that, at a certain point, we started referring to Shankar-Madhav as Shankar-Azan. Azan Peer will continue to maintain his pivotal role, yet Madhav (Madhavdev) also has his own significant position. It is only then that our “caste” can be preserved. Srimanta Sankardev and Sri Sri Madhavdev are esteemed Vaishnav saints in Assam whereas Azan Peer was a Muslim sage who arrived there from Iraq during the 17th century.

Over 1000 bighas of land cleared in Goalpara

The Himanta government is actively involved in measures to safeguard the state’s demographic composition. As part of the drive, encroached lands have been reclaimed in various locations. On 12th July, an eviction operation took place in the Paikan Reserve Forest located in the Goalpara district. 140 hectares (equivalent to 1038 to 1040 bighas) of forest land had been unlawfully taken over predominantly by Muslims.

Tejas Mariswamy, the Divisional Forest Officer of Goalpara outlined that 1,080 families had built houses in this area. The majority of these individuals were Muslims who had migrated from adjacent regions or Bangladesh. A total of 36 bulldozers were utilized during the action and the region was divided into 6 distinct blocks. Nearly 2,500 to 2,700 structures, including houses and shops were dismantled. Over 1,000 police officers and forest guards were deployed for security purposes.

Mamata Banerjee cries “atrocities on Bengalis”

A war of words broke out on social media between Sarma and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee over the removal of infiltrators and illegal occupation in Assam. She complained that the administration is persecuting the Bengali community in Assam by singling them out, labeling it as the BJP’s divisive agenda.

However, Sarma responded that it is not the Bengalis but rather Muslim infiltrators who are being expelled from Assam. He also referenced a statement from the Supreme Court which characterized infiltration as an external invasion.",chief minister assam himanta biswa sarma stated around 29 lakh bighas nearly 10 lakh acre land assam reported occupied “bangladeshi infiltrator doubtful citizen ” mentioned bharatiya janata party bjp government took office 2021 campaign initiated reclaim property encountered international pressure cease action made shocking disclosure 21st july function commemorating fourth anniversary multipurpose agricultural project garukhuti darang district project commenced 2021 date 77 420 bighas land 25 500 acre cleared encroachment “today land garukhuti occupied illegally converted productive agricultural field model aim replicate across encroached area assam ” conveyed last 4 year freed 42 000 acre land encroacher dedicated public use pic twitter com aawdkmcntk — himanta biswa sarma himantabiswa july 21 2025 according medium report sarma remarked “after successful execution campaign darang district initiative also extended borsola lumding burhapahar pabha batadrava chapar paikan last four year reclaimed 1 29 lakh bigha around 43 000 acre occupied land considerable portion allocated forest development citizen state ” declared “if anyone belief two three campaign intimidated confront directly bow mistaken martyr assam movement certainly avenged ” mentioned assam movement 1983 1985 prevailing sense defeat many individual “surrendered” congress changed political trajectory state shankar madhav became shankar azan sarma pointed certain point started referring shankar madhav shankar azan azan peer continue maintain pivotal role yet madhav madhavdev also significant position “caste” preserved srimanta sankardev sri sri madhavdev esteemed vaishnav saint assam whereas azan peer muslim sage arrived iraq 17th century 1000 bighas land cleared goalpara himanta government actively involved measure safeguard state’s demographic composition part drive encroached land reclaimed various location 12th july eviction operation took place paikan reserve forest located goalpara district 140 hectare equivalent 1038 1040 bighas forest land unlawfully taken predominantly muslim tejas mariswamy divisional forest officer goalpara outlined 1 080 family built house area majority individual muslim migrated adjacent region bangladesh total 36 bulldozer utilized action region divided 6 distinct block nearly 2 500 2 700 structure including house shop dismantled 1 000 police officer forest guard deployed security purpose mamata banerjee cry “atrocities bengalis” war word broke social medium sarma west bengal chief minister mamata banerjee removal infiltrator illegal occupation assam complained administration persecuting bengali community assam singling labeling bjp’s divisive agenda however sarma responded bengali rather muslim infiltrator expelled assam also referenced statement supreme court characterized infiltration external invasion
OpIndia,22/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/vp-jagdeep-dhankhar-calls-it-quits-read-how-he-kept-questioning-the-judiciary-seeking-accountability-and-objecting-to-their-overreach/,"VP Jagdeep Dhankhar calls it quits: Read how he kept questioning the judiciary, seeking accountability and objecting to their overreach","On the 21st of July 2025, Vice‑President Jagdeep Dhankhar resigned and submitted his letter of resignation to President Droupadi Murmu, citing medical reasons and the need to prioritise his health.

The resignation came on the opening day of the Monsoon Session of Parliament, catching many by surprise amid a busy legislative agenda. Speculations are rife about the timing of Dhankhar’s resignation, with the opposition claiming that the reasons behind his stepping down may be far deeper than just health reasons.

In his letter to President Droupadi Murmu, Jagdeep Dhankhar invoked Article 67(a) of the Constitution to make his resignation effective immediately. Citing ongoing health challenges, he stated his intention to “prioritise health care and abide by medical advice.”

From the very onset in 2022, Dhankhar’s tenure as Vice President was marked by his vocal criticism of the judiciary, especially on the issues of its overreach and accountability. Being a seasoned lawyer himself and having a background in the Supreme Court and the Rajasthan High Court, Jagdeep Dhankhar consistently raised concerns over the alleged encroachment of the powers of the legislature and executive by the judiciary, arguing that their actions undermined the supremacy of Parliament and the balance of powers as prescribed in the Constitution.

“Judiciary cannot become executive”: When Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar warned the judiciary that its overreach might destabilise governance

Hitting back at the judiciary regarding the overturning of parliamentary amendments to the Constitution in December 2022, VP Jagdeep Dhankhar warned that the judiciary cannot become the legislative or the executive because doing so may destabilise the system of government as a whole.

Dhankhar stated during the eighth LM Singhvi memorial lecture that our judiciary, as one of the important institutions of government, cannot be the executive or legislative.

“The doctrine of separation of power is fundamental to our governance. Any incursion, howsoever subtle, in the domain of the other by one has the capacity or potential to unsettle the apple cart of governance,” then vice president stated.

“India in 2015-16 was dealing with a constitutional amendment act and as a matter of record the entire Lok Sabha voted unanimously and there was no abstention in Lok Sabha and that amendment act was passed. In Rajya Sabha, there was no opposition. We the people their ordainment came to be reflected through the most sanctified mechanisms through the applicable mechanisms. That power was undone. The world does not know of any such instance. I appeal to all judicial minds please think of a parallel in the world where a constitutional provision can be undone,” the vice president stated.

In the presence of then Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud, several Supreme Court judges, Union Ministers, then Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and several lawyers, Dhankhar further said, “Power resides in ‘We the People’ – their mandate, their wisdom… If a constitutional provision that carries the ordainment of the people at large in such a vibrant democracy is undone, what will happen? I appeal to the people here, they constitute a judicial elite class, thinking minds, intellectuals – please find out a parallel in the world where a constitutional provision can be undone.”

He also asserted that while the Indian Constitution clearly states in Article 145(3) that the court may interpret the Constitution where a serious question of law is involved. “Nowhere it say a provision can be run down.”

When VP Jagdeep Dhankhar came down heavily on the Supreme Court for scrapping the NJAC

Back in December 2022, Dhankhar criticised the Supreme Court over the 99th Constitutional Amendment Bill paving way for the National Judicial Appointment Commission (NJAC), which was undone by the Supreme Court in 2015.

“The Parliament in a much-needed historic step passed the 99th Constitutional Amendment Bill, paving the way for the National Judicial Appointment Commission (NJAC). There was unprecedented support for the above. On August 13, 2014, the Lok Sabha unanimously voted in its favour with there being no abstentions. This House too, passed it unanimously on August 14, 2014, with one abstention. Rarely in Parliamentary democracy, there has been such massive support to a Constitutional legislation,” Dhankhar said.

“This process fructified into a Constitutional prescription, after 16 State Assemblies out of 29 States ratified the Central Legislation; the President of India, in terms of Article 111, accorded his consent on December 31, 2014,” he added.

Furthermore, then Vice President, Jagdeep Dhankhar stated that this was the first time that a duly legitimised constitutional prescription was judicially undone, “This historic parliamentary mandate was undone by the Supreme Court on October 16, 2015 by a majority of 4:1 finding the same as not being in consonance with the judicially evolved doctrine of ‘Basic Structure’ of the Constitution,” said.

Dhankhar had called the scrapping of the NJAC a severe compromise of parliamentary sovereignty and disregard of the mandate of the people, of which this house and the Lok Sabha are custodians.

VP Dhankhar had also emphasised that Parliament is the exclusive and ultimate determinative of the architecture of the Constitution.

“We need to bear in mind that in democratic governance, the basis of any ‘Basic Structure’ is the prevalence of primacy of the mandate of the people reflected in the Parliament. Parliament is the exclusive and ultimate determinative of the architecture of the Constitution,” said.

It must be recalled that back in 2014, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government brought the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) Act in an attempt to change the system of appointment of judges. The NJAC was a proposed body, which would have been responsible for the appointment and transfer of judges to the higher judiciary. The NJAC Act and the Constitutional Amendment Act came into force on April 13, 2015. But the top court on October 16, 2015, struck down the NJAC Act. The verdict brought back the primacy of the collegium system of judges appointing judges.

VP Jagdeep Dhankhar differed from Supreme Court’s idea of ‘basic structure’ doctrine

In January 2023, Dhankhar once again reignited the discussion over the doctrine of the separation of powers. This time, he cited the Supreme Court’s landmark judgment in the 1973 Kesavanand Bharati case wherein the court had ruled that while Parliament had the authority to amend the Constitution, it cannot amend its basic structure.

Delivering his inaugural address at the 83rd All-India Presiding Officers Conference in Jaipur, Jagdeep Dhankhar questioned: “Are we a democratic nation?”

Asserting that all three pillars of democracy: legislature, executive and judiciary must function within their limits, then Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar said, “In a democratic society, the basis of any basic structure is supremacy of the people, sovereignty of the people, sovereignty of Parliament. Executive thrives on the sovereignty of Parliament. Legislatures and Parliament decide who will be the Chief Minister, who will be the Prime Minister. The ultimate power is with the Legislature. The Legislature decides who will be in other institutions. In such a situation, all Constitutional institutions – the Legislative, Executive, Judiciary – are required to be within their limits.”

Expressing his disagreement over the Supreme Court ruling in the Kesavanand Bharati case that the Parliament cannot amend the constitution’s basic structure, Dhankhar said, “In 1973, in the Kesavananda Bharati case, the Supreme Court gave the idea of basic structure, saying that Parliament can amend the Constitution, but not its basic structure. With due respect to the Judiciary, I cannot subscribe to this.”

‘Time has come to revisit’: When Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar questioned the involvement of the CJI in executive appointments

In February 2025, Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar questioned how the judiciary can be involved in executive appointments as the Supreme Court of India was hearing a petition seeking to include the Chief Justice of India in the selection committee for the Election Commission. He said while earlier the executive yielded to the inclusion of judges in executive functions, it was time to revisit the norms.

Speaking at the National Judicial Academy, Bhopal, Dhankhar said that such a system should not exist in a democracy like India. He wondered how the Chief Justice of India participates in the selection of the CBI director, even by “statutory prescription”.

The vice president said, “To stir your minds, how can in a country like ours or in any democracy, by statutory prescription, the Chief Justice of India participate in the selection of the CBI director! Can there be any legal rationale for it? I can appreciate that the statutory prescription took shape because the Executive of the day has yielded to a judicial verdict. But time has come to revisit.”

Jagdeep Dhankhar further said, “This surely does not merge with democracy. How can we involve the Chief Justice of India in any executive appointment?”

Dhankhar went on to say that while the Supreme Court has the power to interpret the constitution, there can be no “arrogation of authority” under the guise of interpretation. The essence and spirit which the founding fathers had in mind under Article 145(3) must be respected.”

He further advocated for an increase in the constitutional bench strength, as originally the constitution bench comprised the majority of total judges.

“When the strength of the Supreme Court was eight judges, under Article 145(3), there was a stipulation that interpretation of the Constitution would be by a bench of five judges or more. Please note, when this strength was eight, it was five. And the Constitution allows the highest court of the land to interpret the Constitution. If I analyse arithmetically, they were very sure the interpretation will be by the majority of judges, because the strength then was eight. That five stands as it is. And the number (of total judges) is more than fourfold,” he said.

VP Dhankhar’s advocacy for including domain experts in arbitral process instead of retired judges

In March 2025, Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar said that the arbitral process in India is “just an additional burden to the normal hierarchical mechanism of adjudication.”

Addressing the Colloquium organised by the India International Arbitration Centre (IIAC) at Bharat Mandapam, Dhankhar said, “Arbitrators play as much critical role as members of the bar associated with the arbiter process. Surprisingly, there is, I’m saying it with utmost restraint, absolute tight-fist control of a segment of a category that is involved with arbiter process determination. This tight-fist control emanates out of judicial feats. And if we examine it on an objective platform, it is excruciatingly painful.”

Emphasising the significance of Article 136 and its effects on the arbitration process, Dhankhar said that while Article 136 was supposed to be a narrow slit, it is hurting the arbitral process.

“The Attorney General of the country can really reflect and make a big change. Which country in the world, Attorney, tell me, has suo moto cognisance by the highest court? I’m sure I can’t look around. And Article 136 intervention was supposed to be a narrow-slit. The wall has been demolished with anything and everything under the sun, including what a magistrate has to do, what a Session Judge has to do, what a District Judge has to do, and what a High Court Judge has to do. That wall demolition is also hurting the arbitral process. All I am suggesting, in all humility and as a concerned citizen of this country, is that the issue you are debating is critical to micro and small industries. They want a facile, easy arbitral process”.

Jagdeep Dhankhar condemned Supreme Court’s “judicial overreach”, calling it an unelected ‘super Parliament’

In April 2025, VP Jagdeep Dhankhar harshly criticised the recent Supreme Court verdict regarding the powers of the Governor and the President under Articles 200 and 201 of the Constitution. In the Judgment passed on 8th April 2025, a division bench of the Supreme Court set a time limit, not envisaged in the Constitution, on the exercise of power to grant or refuse assent to a state Bill by the President and the Governor. The Supreme Court prescribed a deadline of 3 months on the President’s power to grant or refuse assent to a Bill reserved by the Governor for his consideration.

Without mincing words, VP Dhankhar questioned the Supreme Court for issuing a direction to the President of India. He reminded the Supreme Court that its power is limited to interpreting the Constitution. “We cannot have a situation where you direct the President of India, and on what basis? The only right you have under the Constitution is to interpret the Constitution under Article 145(3), ” said the Vice President in an address during the Valedictory Function of the 6th Rajya Sabha Internship Program at Vice-President’s Enclave on 17th April.

“The President is called upon to decide in a time-bound manner, and if not, it becomes law. So we have judges who will legislate, who will perform executive functions, who will act as super-parliament, and absolutely have no accountability because the law of the land does not apply to them,” he said.

Highlighting the fact that the judgment, which had the effect of modifying the concerned provisions, was delivered by a bench of two judges which did not represent the majority of the total number of judges in the Supreme Court.

“When Article 145(3) was there, the number of judges in the Supreme Court was eight, 5 out of 8, now 5 out of 30 and odd. But forget about it, the judges who issued a mandamus virtually to the President and presented a scenario that it will be the law of the land, have forgotten the power of the Constitution. How can that combination of judges deal with something under Article 145(3) if preserved, it was then for five out of eight. We need to make amends for that also now. Five out of eight would mean interpretation will be by majority. Well, five constitutes more than the majority in eight. But leave that aside. Article 142 has become a nuclear missile against Democratic forces, available to the judiciary 24 x 7,” Dhankhar said.

Notably, in the verdict passed in The State of Tamil Nadu v The Governor of Tamil Nadu and Anr, the Apex Court examined the ambit of powers of the President and the Governor conferred under Articles 200 and 201 of the Constitution. The Supreme Court held that the President should decide on the Bills sent to him by the Governor for consideration within 3 months, and that any delay beyond the prescribed time limit should be justified by recording reasons. Besides, the Court ruled that if the President fails to decide on a Bill within 3 months, then the State government can seek the issuance of the writ of mandamus from the Supreme Court against the President. The judgment has been widely criticised for alleged judicial overreach or a judicial attempt to effectively amend the constitution.

Dhankhar questioned the handling of the Justice Yashwant Varma case

Former Vice-President Dhankhar had also raised questions on how the Supreme Court handled the matter relating to the discovery of huge amounts of unaccounted cash at the house of Justice Yashwant Varma. “An event happened on the night of the 14th and 15th of March in New Delhi, at the residence of a judge. For seven days, no one knew about it. We have to ask questions to ourselves. Is the delay explainable? Condonable? Does it not raise certain fundamental questions? In any ordinary situation, and ordinary situations define the rule of law, things would have been different. It was only on 21st March, disclosed by a newspaper, that people of the country were shocked as never before, ” the Vice-President remarked.

“I support judicial independence — but ACCOUNTABILITY IS KEY.” pic.twitter.com/THpUDUe6aO — Megh Updates 🚨™ (@MeghUpdates) July 7, 2025

“Thereafter, fortunately, in the public domain, we had input from an authoritative source, the Supreme Court of India. And the input indicated culpability. Input did not lead to doubt that something was amiss. Something requires to be investigated. Now the nation waits with bated breath. The nation is restive because one of our institutions, to which people have always looked up with the highest respect and deference, was put in the dock,” he added.

Jagdeep Dhankhar: The man who questioned judicial overreach, sought accountability and advocated for balance of powers even in the face of backlash from the opposition and slandering by the leftist ecosystem

Dhankhar’s fierce critiques of what he deemed judicial overreach and encroachment of the powers of the legislature were not without pushback. Beyond the insulting mimicries, several opposition leaders labelled Dhankhar as ‘non-neutral’ and his comments slamming the judiciary ‘unconstitutional’. The opposition parties and the leftist media cabal even accused the former VP of ‘undermining’ judicial independence. Not to forget, the leftist propaganda portal The Wire went as far as to call Dhankhar a “partisan attack dog” over VP Dhankhar’s criticism of the Supreme Court for using Article 142 and calling it a “nuclear missile against democratic forces”.

Despite the slandering, mockery and criticism, Dhankhar did not shy away from raising concern over judicial overreach, particularly in matters involving a delicate balance of power among the judiciary, executive and legislature. Even in the judge Yaswant Varma case, Jagdeep Dhankhar publicly questioned the actions of the Supreme Court, raising concerns regarding accountability in a democracy wherein elected representatives are subject to scrutiny but judges are nearly immune to all sorts of accountability and scrutiny.

While the opposition and the leftist media ecosystem accused VP Dhankhar of delivering politically charged rhetoric at the behest of his ‘political masters’, the BJP, VP Dhankhar’s remarks were not politically charged or at odds with his constitutional duty, rather, his criticism of the judiciary was driven by a genuine concern over a pattern wherein the judiciary seems to be discharging the duties of President, and at times those of the Parliament as well.

Dhankhar’s courage, however, has not been surprising as even during his tenure as the governor of West Bengal, he repeatedly raised concern over post-poll violence in the state and severely criticised the TMC government for the Birbhum massacre. He remained at loggerheads with the CM Mamata Banerjee-led state government over issues pertaining to federalism and governance, condemning the near-collapse of democracy in the state.

While the opposition and its media cheerleaders mocked Jagdeep Dhankhar, belittled the importance of the Vice President’s post and projected the judiciary as somewhat sacrosanct to criticism, even moved a failed impeachment motion, Jagdeep Dhankhar stood his ground, not for personal gains, not for clout, not for political leverage, but for democracy, for constitution and the supremacy of the people’s mandate.

Several parliamentarians had earlier also raised concerns over judicial activism and overreach; however, Dhankhar’s interventions brought the debate to the forefront, triggering the judiciary, lawmakers and the public to ponder over the question of the judiciary’s role in a healthy democracy.

Jagdeep Dhankhar’s tenure as the Vice President of India and Rajya Sabha chairman will be remembered for many good reasons, especially his role as a defender of constitutional balance. He gave a fervent call for judicial accountability, critiqued judicial overreach while reiterating his belief in parliamentary supremacy. While the opposition parties gave him nothing but insults, mockery and hate, Dhankhar tried to accommodate opposition voices despite ideological differences. Dhankhar’s resignation marks the end of a chapter; however, the questions he raised about the judiciary’s role and accountability will continue to shape India’s constitutional discourse.",21st july

Achuthanandan, died on Monday (21st July, 2025) at the age of 101. He passed away at a private hospital in Thiruvananthapuram, where he was undergoing treatment due to age-related complications. The veteran CPI(M) leader had been out of public life since he suffered a minor stroke in 2019 and was residing with his son in the state capital.

Achuthanandan, Chief Minister of Kerala between 2006 and 2011, was a leading figure of the Indian Left movement.

Achuthanandan was famous for taking bold positions on matters that others, even in his leftist fold, didn’t dare to approach. One of these was in 2010, when he created political controversy by warning against an organised campaign to Islamise Kerala in what he called “Love Jihad.” He had stated, quoting intelligence reports and High Court inputs, that the Popular Front of India (PFI) had resorted to using love, money, and marriage to bring non-Muslims of a young age into Islam.

The debate over his 2010 comment reappears today amidst several cases of religious conversion, such as the Agra case, where social media and marriage are reportedly being employed to entice people into conversions. Achuthanandan’s alerts, dismissed as alarmist by some in the past, now resonate in current national discussions on religious radicalisation.",former chief minister kerala v achuthanandan died monday 21st july 2025 age 101 passed away private hospital thiruvananthapuram undergoing treatment due age related complication veteran cpi leader public life since suffered minor stroke 2019 residing son state capital achuthanandan chief minister kerala 2006 2011 leading figure indian left movement achuthanandan famous taking bold position matter others even leftist fold didn’t dare approach one 2010 created political controversy warning organised campaign islamise kerala called “love jihad ” stated quoting intelligence report high court input popular front india pfi resorted using love money marriage bring non muslim young age islam debate 2010 comment reappears today amidst several case religious conversion agra case social medium marriage reportedly employed entice people conversion achuthanandan’s alert dismissed alarmist past resonate current national discussion religious radicalisation
OpIndia,21/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/mamata-banerjee-21st-july-1993-martyrs-day-cpim-governemnt-political-significance-explained/,21st July 1993: How Mamata Banerjee used election conspiracy theory and an ill-managed protest march against CPIM to gain power in West Bengal,"The day was 21st July 1993. Mamata Banerjee, who was the then West Bengal State President of the Youth Congress, had organised a protest march to the Writers’ Building in Kolkata in a campaign dubbed Writers’ Chalo Abhiyan.

Back then, the Writers’ Building served as the Office of the Chief Minister of West Bengal, Jyoti Basu.

The march was nothing new for Mamata Banerjee, who had shaped her entire political career on street fights and public drama. The disruptive style of protests on populist issues kept her in the limelight.

The motive behind the 21st July march to Writers’ Building

After the Jyoti Basu-led-CPIM government won the 1991 Vidhan Sabha election with a large margin, Mamata Banerjee began to peddle the conspiracy theory that the party had won the polls through ‘scientific rigging.’

Back then, votes were cast through ballot papers, and the presentation of voter ID was not mandatory. Incidentally, Mamata Banerjee became the Member of Parliament (MP) from the Kolkata Dakshin constituency in 1991.

She was appointed the Minister of State for Human Resource Development under the Congress-led Narasimha Rao government at the Centre.

Although she was part of the National politics, Mamata Banerjee had her eyes set on the power corridors of West Bengal.

Despite holding an important portfolio in the Narasimha Rao government, she was actively involved in the political affairs of West Bengal.

This was evident from her forced entry to the Writers’ Building in January 1993 with a rape victim, highlighting breakdown of law and order under the CPIM government.

After being unceremoniously pulled out of the office of then Chief Minister Jyoti Basu, Mamata Banerjee made plans to ambush Writers’ Building in the following 6 months’ time.

She needed a new issue, and the election conspiracy theory of alleged ‘scientific rigging’ of votes by CPIM provided the perfect foundation for a new protest and much-needed public drama.

Mamata Banerjee, in her capacity as the West Bengal State President of the Youth Congress, demanded mandating voter ID cards with photos and their categorisation as the ‘only valid document’ for casting votes.

This was the job of the Election Commission of India (ECI). At that time, the Election Commissioner was chosen by the President on the recommendation of the Union Cabinet.

Given that the Congress party was in power at the Centre, it did not make sense for Mamata Banerjee and Youth Congress to launch Writers’ Chalo Abhiyan in Kolkata against the Left government over photo Voter ID issue.

But as history would have it, the events of 21st July 1993 catapulted the political career of Mamata Banerjee.

What happened on that fateful day of 21st July 1993

As part of Writers’ Chalo Abhiyan, members of the Youth Congress gathered at five different points across Kolkata and began marching towards the Office of the West Bengal Chief Minister. The objective was to lay siege to the building.

At about 1 km away from their target destination on Brabourne Road, the police stopped the incoming Youth Congress workers from marching ahead. Section 144 was imposed in the area in advance.

According to the then Police Commissioner Tushar Talukdar, Mamata’s supporters, who were at the Mayo Road Crossing, pelted stones at the police and set multiple vehicles on fire. He said that the warnings given by the on-duty police personnel fell on deaf ears.

“Watching the unruly crowd, one of my officers said the only option to restore order was to open fire, or else the policemen and the state secretariat would come under attack. The next thing I heard was that the cops had opened fire and many Youth Congress workers were injured. Later, I learnt that 13 people had died,” he told The Telegraph.

The Youth Congress workers attacked the police, forcing the latter to resort to lathi-charge and firing tear gas shells. When they outnumbered the police and sensing no way out, the cops resorted to firing at the incoming mob.

Mamata Banerjee was also injured during the scuffle with the police. She had even climbed a traffic police post in the middle of the road. Youth Congress workers surrounded her and formed a protective ring to shield her from the police.

Sourjya Bhowmick writes in the book ‘Gangster State: The Rise and Fall of the CPI(M) in West Bengal’ (Pages 172-173) –

“Mamata raided the citadel of the state government, the Writers’ Building, on 21 July 1993, with the demand to make voter identity cards mandatory. Thousands of Youth Congress workers had thronged to central Calcutta and marched towards the majestic red Writers’ Building...

…So it did not take much time for the unruly, undisciplined crowd to emerge and spill out onto the streets when Mamata raised her voice against rigging. Section 144 had been imposed, but a part of the crowd broke the curfew on Mayo Road and attacked policemen. When the police started lathicharging, the crowd scattered and rumours of police firing travelled fast to other parts of the city like the Tea Board Crossing, where Banerjee was leading the protest. She tried to control the crowd but to no avail.

…Chief Minister Jyoti Basu gave strict orders to the administration to not allow anyone to seize the state secretariat. The police force had to abide by the instructions. But Congress workers outnumbered the police. In self-defence or enraged that hooligans had injured their colleagues, the police opened fire at the protestors, killing thirteen near the Writers’ Building.“

The aftermath of the fateful day

A total of 13 Youth Congress workers died on 21st July 1993, who are referred to as ‘Martyrs’ by the Mamata Banerjee-led-West Bengal government.

They include Srikanta Sharma, Bandhan Das, Dilip Das, Asim Das, Keshab Bairagi, Biswanath Roy, Kalyan Banerjee, Pradip Roy, Ratan Mondal, Murari Chakraborty, Ranajit Das, Abdul Khalek and Inu.

After coming to power in 2011, Mamata Banerjee formed a judicial commission led by former Chief Justice of Orissa High Court, Susanta Chatterjee, to investigate the 1993 police firing case.

The Commission ordered a compensation of ₹25 lakhs to the family of each of the victims. It noted that the control room police officers ‘overreacted to please their political bosses’ and held them responsible.

The Commission also summoned former Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who justified the police action against the incoming mob of Youth Congress workers.

He had stated, “At that time, in principle, I did not feel the need for a judicial inquiry and I still stick to my views. In the name of a march, it was an attempt to capture Writers’ Buildings. Given the situation, the police had to resort to firing.”

Political significance of the Martyr’s Day

The episode of 21st July 1993 stirred a renewed sense of sympathy among the masses for the Banglar meye (daughter of Bengal), Mamata Banerjee. Overnight, she became a star in the political sphere of West Bengal.

Just 5 years later, she broke away from the Congress to start her own political party, i.e. the All India Trinamool Congress (AITC).

The experience of 21st July 1993 came in handy to Mamata Banerjee during the years 2005-2007 when she led mass protests against the CPIM government in Singur and Nandigram.

By 2011, Mamata Banerjee brought an end to the 34-year-old CPIM rule in West Bengal. The campaign of 18 years finally culminated at the Writer’s Building.

The protest march of the Youth Congress has since been appropriated by the TMC and renamed ‘Martyr’s Day’. It is observed each year by the Mamata government with pomp and show at Esplanade More (Dharmatala) in Kolkata.",day 21st july 1993 mamata banerjee west bengal state president youth congress organised

OpIndia,21/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/agra-conversion-racket-mastermind-abdul-rehman-arrested-from-delhi-missing-haryana-girl-rescued-from-his-home/,"Agra conversion racket: Mastermind Abdul Rehman arrested from Delhi, missing Haryana girl rescued from his home","In a major breakthrough in the Agra religious conversion case, the Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) and the Intelligence Bureau (IB) have arrested mastermind Abdul Rehman from the Mustafabad area of Delhi. According to officials, Abdul Rehman is believed to be the main brains behind the widespread religious conversion racket that recently came to light in Agra. Abdul Rehman’s house was searched, and a large number of books meant for brainwashing people into conversion were recovered from there.

This is the 11th arrest so far in the case. Abdul Rehman, originally from Firozabad, was earlier a Hindu named Mahendra Pal. He had converted to Christianity first, and later converted to Islam. His involvement in the racket was reportedly inspired by jailed cleric Kaleem Siddiqui, who is currently serving a life sentence for running a similar conversion network.

Ties to foreign funding

Investigators say that Abdul Rehman’s nephew lives in London, and they suspect that he may have been helping with foreign funding for the conversion activities. Teams from the ATS and IB are now conducting raids again in Delhi and Kolkata based on fresh leads.

The agencies are also getting important information from the ten people already in custody, who are currently on a 10-day police remand. These individuals, many of whom were themselves converts from Hinduism to Islam, have revealed how they were brainwashed and later recruited into the racket. During questioning, they said they were taught that converting others was the only way to attain heaven, or “jannat,” and they began to actively target vulnerable people, calling it “adding new relations.”

A victim rescued from accused’s house

From Abdul Rehman’s residence, police also rescued a woman named Mamta from Haryana, who had been brought there for conversion. The authorities also recovered several books that promoted religious conversion, further strengthening the case against him.

The agencies believe that after Kaleem Siddiqui’s arrest and conviction by an NIA court, Abdul Rehman had taken over and continued running the network. He is suspected of being in regular contact with other key members of the racket, many of whom operated under fake identities.

Several members were Hindus before conversion

Police Commissioner Deepak Kumar shared the names and former identities of the accused, many of whom were once Hindus. Ayesha from Goa was earlier S.B. Krishna, Ali Hassan from Kolkata was once Shekhar Rai, Abu Rehman from Dehradun was previously Rupendra Baghel, Mohammad Ali from Jaipur was earlier Piyush Singh Panwar, and Mustafa from Delhi was formerly known as Manoj. Similarly, Mohammad Ibrahim from Kolkata used to be Reet Banik. Officials say these individuals were heavily brainwashed and then turned into recruiters to pull more people into the network, mostly through social media.

Missing sisters are now demanding release of accused

Two sisters had gone missing from Agra’s Sadar Bazar area. One of the sister’s photo with an AK-47 was shared on social media which prompted the investigation. During questioning, the girls told the police they were willing to return home, but only on the condition that the arrested accused be released. According to them, those arrested had done nothing wrong and were only “serving religion.” The sisters claimed that if the accused remained in jail, none of them would go to heaven.

The older sister, an MSc in Zoology and an MPhil graduate, had been preparing for the NET exam in Agra when she met a woman named Saima, also known as Khushboo, from Jammu and Kashmir. Attracted by her appearance and behaviour, she became close to her. Saima slowly introduced her to Islamic teachings and sent her videos promoting religious conversion. Soon, the older sister started wearing a burqa and offering namaz at home. Although her family brought her back from Kashmir during the COVID lockdown, she had already been mentally influenced and soon convinced her younger sister to follow the same path.

The younger sister admitted during questioning that she was already frustrated at home, her mother would often scold her, either for her studies or household chores. Seeing her elder sister’s new way of life, she believed it was better than what she had. She started following her, thinking it was a way to live more freely and meaningfully.

Social media used to target victims

Many of the accused were reportedly using Instagram and other platforms to find and communicate with potential converts. One such ID named “Connecting Revert” was being run by Reet Banik, alias Mohammad Ibrahim from Kolkata, who was in touch with the sisters. Police say social media played a major role in spreading this racket and attracting more people, especially the youth.",major breakthrough agra religious conversion case anti terrorism squad at intelligence bureau ib arrested mastermind abdul rehman mustafabad area delhi according official abdul rehman believed main brain behind widespread religious conversion racket recently came light agra abdul rehman’s house searched large number book meant brainwashing people conversion recovered 11th arrest far case abdul rehman originally firozabad earlier hindu named mahendra pal converted christianity first later converted islam involvement racket reportedly inspired jailed cleric kaleem siddiqui currently serving life sentence running similar conversion network tie foreign funding investigator say abdul rehman’s nephew life london suspect may helping foreign funding conversion activity team at ib conducting raid delhi kolkata based fresh lead agency also getting important information ten people already custody currently 10 day police remand individual many convert hinduism islam revealed brainwashed later recruited racket questioning said taught converting others way attain heaven “jannat ” began actively target vulnerable people calling “adding new relation ” victim rescued accused’s house abdul rehman’s residence police also rescued woman named mamta haryana brought conversion authority also recovered several book promoted religious conversion strengthening case agency believe kaleem siddiqui’s arrest conviction nia court abdul rehman taken continued running network suspected regular contact key member racket many operated fake identity several member hindu conversion police commissioner deepak kumar shared name former identity accused many hindu ayesha goa earlier b krishna ali hassan kolkata shekhar rai abu rehman dehradun previously rupendra baghel mohammad ali jaipur earlier piyush singh panwar mustafa delhi formerly known manoj similarly mohammad ibrahim kolkata used reet banik official say individual heavily brainwashed turned recruiter pull people network mostly social medium missing sister demanding release accused two sister gone missing agra’s sadar bazar area one sister’s photo ak 47 shared social medium prompted investigation questioning girl told police willing return home condition arrested accused released according arrested done nothing wrong “serving religion ” sister claimed accused remained jail none would go heaven older sister msc zoology mphil graduate preparing net exam agra met woman named saima also known khushboo jammu kashmir attracted appearance behaviour became close saima slowly introduced islamic teaching sent video promoting religious conversion soon older sister started wearing burqa offering namaz home although family brought back kashmir covid lockdown already mentally influenced soon convinced younger sister follow path younger sister admitted questioning already frustrated home mother would often scold either study household chore seeing elder sister’s new way life believed better started following thinking way live freely meaningfully social medium used target victim many accused reportedly using instagram platform find communicate potential convert one id named “connecting revert” run reet banik alias mohammad ibrahim kolkata touch sister police say social medium played major role spreading racket attracting people especially youth
OpIndia,21/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/agra-conversion-case-piyush-panwar-mohammad-ali-mafia/,"Agra conversion racket: Piyush Panwar became Mohammad Ali for a girl, she rejected him after converting him, he then joined the conversion mafia to...","The Uttar Pradesh police has nabbed 10 individuals under “Mission Asmita” in a conversion racket case from six different states. The racket was based out of Agra in Uttar Pradesh. One of the accused arrested in the case is Mohammad Ali, who was arrested from Rajasthan.

Mohammad Ali, arrested in the pan-India religious conversion racket case has now declared his intention to do “ghar wapsi” and return to the fold of Hinduism, reported NDTV. The accused even claimed to be himself a victim as well.

According to sources, Mohammad Ali broke down during the interrogation in Agra jail and requested that he wants to go back home. Furthermore, he highlighted his intention to return to being a Hindu. Ali even expressed his wish to apologise to his parents, who severed their relationship with him following his conversion to Islam.

Piyush Panwar becomes Mohammad Ali for a girl

Piyush Panwar’s drastic journey to becoming Mohammad Ali began in 2021 when he met a young woman named Shana from Tonk, Rajasthan. They decided to marry after falling in love. However, the girl asserted that he must embrace Islam to which he consented and changed his name to Mohammad Ali. However, she rejected him after that. Following which, Mohammad Ali (earlier known as Piyush Panwar) married a Muslim girl from Uttar Pradesh’s Bareilly.

Ali met Mohammad Gaus, a member of the banned terror group PFI on his way to become a Muslim. The latter introduced him to Kalim Siddiqui, a Delhi cleric who was found guilty in a different conversion case last year.

Mohammad Ali then travelled to West Bengal to receive religious education. He spent three months at the madarsas in Asansol, Bardhaman and Katwapara. He then connected with Ayesha, a Goan woman, who has also been arrested in the conversion case, on Instagram approximately a year ago. Her name was SB Krishna before she converted to Islam. She used to keep track of the names of the girls who had converted to Islam. He even unveiled that their network is affiliated with Popular Front of India (PFI) and Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI).

The shocking findings

Hasan Ali and Osama from Kolkata, Rahman Qureshi from Agra, Abu Talib from Muzaffarnagar (Uttar Pradesh), Abdur Rehman from Dehradun (Uttarakhand), Mohammad Ali and Junaid Qureshi from Rajasthan and Mustafa from Delhi have been arrested by the cops in the case.

Notably, Shekhar Roy alias Hasan Ali, Hrithik Banik also known as Mohammad Ibrahim, Rupendra Singh identified as Abdur Rehman and Manoj referred to as Mustafa also converted from Hinduism to Islam.

The police disclosed that they were systematically pushing the impoverished, marginalized and socially disadvantaged Hindus to convert. The lured the unsuspecting people under the guise of performing miracles, providing cures and offering deliverance from malevolent spirits.

Authorities informed that would meet people under bogus names and trick them in the name of “service work” while concealing their religious identities. Some accused even had ties to religious organizations and were exploiting the same for conversion purposes.

Investigative agencies are currently examining whether the perpetrators received financial support from any international networks as preliminary evidence revealed dubious bank transactions and details of foreign calls.

The inquiry disclosed that the accused managed to find their tragets through madrasas and fake NGOs. These organizations were functioning under the pretense of providing social services. According to police reports, most of the individuals chosen for conversion were from Dalit backgrounds, unemployed or disabled.

The were attracted using enticing offers and monetary aids. The victims were promised assistance with food, healthcare and money for the education of their children. Furthermore, the offenders even shared videos and delivered speeches that propagated conversion. WhatsApp groups were also created. PAN cards and Aadhaar cards were issued based on the new names to evade government scrutiny.

Some of the culprits have previously been booked for their communal actions in the past. The gang referred to itself as “revert” (term used by Muslim converts). They first published an advertisement in the newspaper about those who converted and then prepared required documents through courts. Afterward, the trapped girls are married, making it difficult for them to escape from there and return home.

The information was disclosed by the accused during their questioning by officials from the Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) and Intelligence Bureau (IB). They would often present themselves as reverts on social media after conversion.

It also came to light that the gang seduced those who turned 18 to facilitate their conversion without complications. They were able to present themselves as adults in court. Additionally, they had the legal liberty to convert to a different religion. They could even motivate other people in their circle to follow suit. Hence, several such young men and women were targeted for the purpose of conversion.

The Uttar Pradesh ATS suspects that the link of this gang might also reach Bihar, Bengal, Maharashtra and Kerala. The police have filed a case against all the accused under strict legal provisions. Additionally, an investigation into the groups they were associated with has commenced. According to officials, it could be a small part of a large network that operates across India.

ISIS-style working

The authorities stated, “Police arrested 10 members of an organized gang involved in religious conversion from 6 different states across the country. 11 teams were sent to various states for the same. Two young women who earlier went missing from Agra were being enticed by this group for religious conversion. They were rescued in time by the Agra Police and handed over to their families.”

“These individuals are engaged in similar activities in different states. They target young girls through inducements, love jihad and other methods. This modus operandi of the radicalisation and conversions is a signature style of ISIS (Islmaic State of Iraq and Syria). Initial investigations have indicated that this group has connections with PFI, its political wing SDPI and terrorist organizations in Pakistan. Their illegal operations have been funded from Canada and the United States,” the police outlined.",uttar pradesh police nabbed 10 individual “mission asmita” conversion racket case six different state racket based agra uttar pradesh one accused arrested case mohammad ali arrested rajasthan mohammad ali arrested pan india religious conversion racket case declared intention “ghar wapsi” return fold hinduism reported ndtv accused even claimed victim well according source mohammad ali broke interrogation agra jail requested want go back home furthermore highlighted intention return hindu ali even expressed wish apologise parent severed relationship following conversion islam piyush panwar becomes mohammad ali girl piyush panwar’s drastic journey becoming mohammad ali began 2021 met young woman named shana tonk rajasthan decided marry falling love however girl asserted must embrace islam consented changed name mohammad ali however rejected following mohammad ali earlier known piyush panwar married muslim girl uttar pradesh’s bareilly ali met mohammad gaus member banned terror group pfi way become muslim latter introduced kalim siddiqui delhi cleric found guilty different conversion case last year mohammad ali travelled west bengal receive religious education spent three month madarsas asansol bardhaman katwapara connected ayesha goan woman also arrested conversion case instagram approximately year ago name sb krishna converted islam used keep track name girl converted islam even unveiled network affiliated popular front india pfi social democratic party india sdpi shocking finding hasan ali osama kolkata rahman qureshi agra abu talib muzaffarnagar uttar pradesh abdur rehman dehradun uttarakhand mohammad ali junaid qureshi rajasthan mustafa delhi arrested cop case notably shekhar roy alias hasan ali hrithik banik also known mohammad ibrahim rupendra singh identified abdur rehman manoj referred mustafa also converted hinduism islam police disclosed systematically pushing impoverished marginalized socially disadvantaged hindu convert lured unsuspecting people guise performing miracle providing cure offering deliverance malevolent spirit authority informed would meet people bogus name trick name “service work” concealing religious identity accused even tie religious organization exploiting conversion purpose investigative agency currently examining whether perpetrator received financial support international network preliminary evidence revealed dubious bank transaction detail foreign call inquiry disclosed accused managed find tragets madrasa fake ngo organization functioning pretense providing social service according police report individual chosen conversion dalit background unemployed disabled attracted using enticing offer monetary aid victim promised assistance food healthcare money education child furthermore offender even shared video delivered speech propagated conversion whatsapp group also created pan card aadhaar card issued based new name evade government scrutiny culprit previously booked communal action past gang referred “revert” term used muslim convert first published advertisement newspaper converted prepared required document court afterward trapped girl married making difficult escape return home information disclosed accused questioning official anti terrorism squad at intelligence bureau ib would often present reverts social medium conversion also came light gang seduced turned 18 facilitate conversion without complication able present adult court additionally legal liberty convert different religion could even motivate people circle follow suit hence several young men woman targeted purpose conversion uttar pradesh at suspect link gang might also reach bihar bengal maharashtra kerala police filed case accused strict legal provision additionally investigation group associated commenced according official could small part large network operates across india isi style working authority stated “police arrested 10 member organized gang involved religious conversion 6 different state across country 11 team sent various state two young woman earlier went missing agra enticed group religious conversion rescued time agra police handed family ” “these individual engaged similar activity different state target young girl inducement love jihad method modus operandi radicalisation conversion signature style isi islmaic state iraq syria initial investigation indicated group connection pfi political wing sdpi terrorist organization pakistan illegal operation funded canada united state ” police outlined

By 2026–27, it intends to introduce Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Big Data Analytics in most segments of its operations. From drone operations and battlefield surveillance to combat training and intelligence gathering, the Army is making a systematic plan to utilise these cutting-edge technologies in a more intelligent and organised manner.

According to a report in The Indian Express, the Indian Army seeks to enhance its “battlefield awareness” with the help of AI capabilities that can process enormous volumes of information in a matter of milliseconds. These gadgets comprise AI-driven text summarizers to scan lengthy reports through Large Language Models (LLMs) and provide a summary, AI-driven chatbots able to respond to queries in real time, and voice-to-text to translate voice commands into typed instructions.

The Army will also utilise facial recognition technologies and systems that are able to detect unusual patterns, which might be indicative of a threat. Above that, it is set to collect and examine data streaming in from drones, satellites, aircraft, and sensors on the ground simultaneously. By assembling all this data in real time, commanders will be able to make more timely and precise decisions while out on a mission.

Lessons of Operation Sindoor

The push for this tech transition grew stronger following Operation Sindoor, a cross-border attack conducted in May. The operation to attack terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) saw a lot of drone attacks from both sides. It gave the message that the future of warfare lies in how well you can employ technology, not necessarily weapons, to move quickly and cleverly when things are dangerous.

Task force to lead AI integration

To ensure smooth sailing, the Army is creating a special task force (STF) comprising AI experts to be operated under the Directorate General of Information Systems (DGIS). The team will comprise officers from various branches of the Army and will be tasked with implementing these technologies across the board. Their tasks will include training Army personnel, enhancing technical capabilities, facilitating data sharing and integration, and assisting in the routine maintenance of AI systems.

This task force will also assist the Army in employing AI for combat training simulations, supply chain management, intelligence surveillance, and even monitoring open-source content such as social media or news sites. Operations planning, threat detection, mapping enemy weaknesses, and assisting targeting functions will all be performed using AI tools. In areas where GPS is jammed or inoperable, AI systems will assist navigation. Predictive maintenance equipment will also be brought in to ensure Army gear operates without unexpected failures.

To ensure that AI will be a part of the Army’s normal work, there will be new additions to the General Staff Qualitative Requirements (GSQRs). These are the standards adopted when purchasing any new hardware. From now on, these standards will have AI capabilities as an added element. The Army is also scheduled to install AI capabilities on some of its older hardware and systems wherever it is feasible.

Building for the future

An AI laboratory is also being established at the DGIS, in which new AI models will be created and tested. These will not only be utilised by the Army but will also be integrated with comparable AI tools being developed by the Navy and Air Force, so that all three branches can function in coordination.

To put it simply, the Indian Army’s AI initiative is no longer a concept. It’s becoming a reality with well-defined objectives, definite timelines, and a serious intent to leverage technology for more intelligent and quicker military actions.",indian army preparing major shift functioning 2026–27 intends introduce artificial intelligence ai machine learning ml big data analytics segment operation drone operation battlefield surveillance combat training intelligence gathering army making systematic plan utilise cutting edge technology intelligent organised manner according report indian express indian army seek enhance “battlefield awareness” help ai capability process enormous volume information matter millisecond gadget comprise ai driven text summarizers scan lengthy report large language model llm provide summary ai driven chatbots able respond query real time voice text translate voice command typed instruction army also utilise facial recognition technology system able detect unusual pattern might indicative threat set collect examine data streaming drone satellite aircraft sensor ground simultaneously assembling data real time commander able make timely precise decision mission lesson operation sindoor push tech transition grew stronger following operation sindoor cross border attack conducted may operation attack terror camp pakistan pakistan occupied kashmir pok saw lot drone attack side gave message future warfare lie well employ technology necessarily weapon move quickly cleverly thing dangerous task force lead ai integration ensure smooth sailing army creating special task force stf comprising ai expert operated directorate general information system dgis team comprise officer various branch army tasked implementing technology across board task include training army personnel enhancing technical capability facilitating data sharing integration assisting routine maintenance ai system task force also assist army employing ai combat training simulation supply chain management intelligence surveillance even monitoring open source content social medium news site operation planning threat detection mapping enemy weakness assisting targeting function performed using ai tool area gps jammed inoperable ai system assist navigation predictive maintenance equipment also brought ensure army gear operates without unexpected failure ensure ai part army’s normal work new addition general staff qualitative requirement gsqrs standard adopted purchasing new hardware standard ai capability added element army also scheduled install ai capability older hardware system wherever feasible building future ai laboratory also established dgis new ai model created tested utilised army also integrated comparable ai tool developed navy air force three branch function coordination put simply indian army’s ai initiative longer concept it’s becoming reality well defined objective definite timeline serious intent leverage technology intelligent quicker military action

He encouraged Anand Mahindra, the chairman of Mahindra Group, to consider Andhra Pradesh for manufacturing, promising to impress him with the state’s “speed and approach.” He even added, “Your workforce will feel most welcome and speak whichever language they wish to.”

The minister mentioned that the state appreciates the company’s continued investments and stressed, “I look forward to deepening it further. I have been reading about your group’s expansion plans in EVs, defence and aerospace manufacturing. Andhra Pradesh has tailor-made policies for each sub-sector that can deliver maximum incentives.”

“Why not consider a Mahindra manufacturing facility in the sunrise state Andhra Pradesh to take advantage of our advanced automotive ecosystem and large market. Would love to host your team and showcase the abundant opportunities available here,” Nara Lokesh said.

The latter responded that they are already in talks with the governement about a variety of sectors, including micro-irrigation, solar energy and tourism. “We would be proud to be a partner in Andhra Pradesh’s journey,” he stated.

ధన్యవాదాలు! ఆంధ్రప్రదేశ్‌లో అనేక అవకాశాలు ఉన్నాయి.

The minister has been consistently making pitches to the group and other industrialists, presenting Andhra Pradesh as an optimal choice for establishing industries. Lokesh has highlighted that the state is free from the language politics and violence perpetrated by language activists, in contrast to other southern states and even Maharashtra.

OpIndia,21/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/after-balrampur-and-agra-now-illegal-conversions-in-aligarh-97-women-reported-missing/,"Uttar Pradesh: After Balrampur and Agra, now illegal conversions in Aligarh, 97 missing women suspected to have become victims of this racket","Following Agra and Balrampur, a major illegal conversion racket has now been busted in Aligarh district of Uttar Pradesh. The gang is reportedly suspected of luring as many as 97 women, who are now missing, according to intelligence sources and police.

With the case being very sensitive in nature, several intelligence and special police teams have already been sent to probe the issue in great depth.

The case took a serious turn after Umar Gautam was arrested in Agra. Gautam, while being interrogated, revealed information about the Islamic conversion network as his ‘list’ of women had names from Aligarh as well. There are as many as 97 cases of missing women registered in the district and now Police is investigating each case with a new angle to find out if they have been converted.

In March 2025, two sisters (33 and 18 years old) had gone missing from Aligarh’s Sadar police station. The police sprung into action when one of the sisters’ photographs appeared on social media where she was holding an AK-47 rifle. This revelation led to connection with a well-entrenched illegal conversion network. The sources add that the sisters were forcibly converted and were then kept in a Muslim-dominated area of Kolkata.

How the gang operated

Police investigations show that the gang used social networks, dark websites, and dating applications to lure Hindu women. The members would initially befriend the women, trap them in love, and then brainwash them into converting. The police operation was so secret that even various police teams that were investigating it weren’t aware of each other’s actions. The group is suspected to have connections with banned terror groups such as PFI, SIMI, and Lashkar-e-Taiba. Foreign funding from nations such as Canada, the US, the UK, and Dubai is also reported.

Uttar Pradesh DGP Rajeev Krishna explained that the gang was able to convert hundreds of Hindu women in different states. The arrested individuals in the Agra conversion case are Ayesha (actual name S.B. Krishna from Odisha), Ali Hasan alias Shekhar Rai from Kolkata, and Mohammad Ali from Jaipur. Ayesha reportedly operated the foreign funding and finances of the group, whereas Hasan looked after making influential contacts.

97 women missing in Aligarh

The most startling revelation was that at least 97 women from Aligarh and other surrounding areas have gone missing, most of whom are believed to be victims of this racket of conversion. In a few cases, the women were either misled or forced to convert, and a few of them were even coerced into marriages.

“Mission Asmita” by UP govt

In response, the Yogi Adityanath administration has initiated a special drive named “Mission Asmita” against forced conversions. As part of this, seven special teams of Agra police conducted raids in Kolkata, Jammu & Kashmir, Goa, Rajasthan, Delhi, and Uttarakhand, arresting 10 accused, including a woman. The case has been registered under several sections of the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita and the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Religious Conversion Act, 2021.

DGP Rajeev Krishna compared the gang’s operation model to that of ISIS, saying they used hawala, the dark web, and radical networks to promote religious extremism and demographic change.

According to DCP (Crime Branch) Vikram Singh, the gang duped people by offering fake lottery tickets and prizes, often by impersonating women or foreign businessmen on social media platforms like Facebook and Messenger.

“Five Indians and two Nigerians of a cheating syndicate operating nationwide have been arrested… They used to gain people’s confidence by offering fake lottery tickets, gift or prize schemes, or by impersonating a woman,” DCP Singh told ANI.

The gang collected personal data from Facebook and then sent messages to people through Messenger. The foreign nationals, pretending to be businessmen, called victims from these accounts, built trust over months, and then demanded money under various pretexts.

“Foreign nationals would call the victims posing as businessmen… They would run an account for 5 to 6 months and then deactivate it,” the DCP further said.

The police identified that the group was currently operating an account under the name ‘Vikas’, through which 20-25 victims had already been traced. Initial investigations revealed that the syndicate had been active for over a year.

“Sunday John came to India in 2023. He had a business visa that had expired. He was living illegally here. The second Nigerian came on a medical visa in 2013, and his visa has also expired,” DCP Singh later added.

Among the arrested Indians, Shahrukh and Shahid Raza were identified as the main conspirators. Shahid Raza had previously been jailed in 2016 for a similar crime. He was the first to connect with the Nigerians, while Shahrukh handled the cash flow, Rakesh arranged for the opening of bank accounts, and Faiz created fake Aadhaar cards, the police said.

“Shahrukh used to arrange the money flow. Rakesh used to get the bank accounts opened. Faiz used to get fake Aadhar cards made,” Singh added.

The police found around Rs 3 lakh in cash, along with nine mobile phones, nine passbooks, three cheque books, and multiple ATM cards from the accused. The Nigerians got money deposited into their accounts, while the Indian members would withdraw the money and hand it over to them in cash.

Further investigation is currently underway.

OpIndia,20/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/karnataka-government-forms-sit-to-probe-allegations-on-dharmasthala-mass-burials/,"Karnataka government forms SIT to probe allegations on Dharmasthala mass burials, mother of missing girl lodges complaint after former sanitation worker made shocking claims","In the latest development in the Dharmasthala mass burial case, the Karnataka government ordered the formation of an SIT headed by the Director General of Police (Internal Security Division), Pronab Mohanty, on 19th July. He will be assisted by Deputy Inspector General of Police (Recruitment) M N Anucheth and IPS officers Soumyalatha S K and Jitendra Kumar Dayama.

According to S Ambika, Under Secretary to the Government, Home Department, the government has ordered the formation of the SIT for a comprehensive investigation into the case.

The SIT was formed after the State Commission for Women called for an SIT probe into the allegations relating to the discovery of numerous human skeletons at Dharmasthala in Karnataka. On 14th July, the Chairperson of the Karnataka State Commission for Women wrote a letter seeking an investigation led by senior police officers into the cases of missing female students and women, unnatural deaths, murders and rapes reported in the last two decades. All related criminal cases reported in all police stations across the state will be transferred to the SIT.

Background of the case

The case caught attention after an unknown man, who later turned out to be a former sanitation worker employed by the Lord Manjunatha shrine in Dharmasthala, filed a complaint with the police claiming that he was forced to bury dead bodies of women and minor girls in Dharmsthala. His complaint was followed by another complaint filed by a woman named Sujatha, whose daughter had gone missing while on a trip to the pilgrimage town of Dharmasthala.

The former sanitation worker arrives in court to give testimony

On June 3, 2025, the former sanitation worker submitted a complaint to the police, accompanied by photo evidence of skeletal remains. In his complaint, the former sanitation worker claimed that he was forced to bury hundreds of bodies of murder victims, including women and young girls, many of whom were sexually assaulted, between 1998 and 2014. “Many of the female bodies were without clothing or underwear. Some bore clear signs of sexual assault and violence: wounds or strangulation that indicated violence… More than 100 women, including students, were raped, murdered and buried…,” wrote the former sanitation worker in his complaint.

About a week after filing the complaint, the former sanitation worker appeared before a court, covered head to toe to conceal his identity, to testify to the allegations made in his complaint. He claimed that the culprits were influential people linked to the temple administration.

His complaint was followed by another complaint filed on 15th July, by Sujatha, the mother of a first-year MBBS student named Ananya Bhat, who went missing in 2003 during a college trip to Dharmasthala. 60-year-old Sujatha believes that her daughter might be among the victims mentioned in the former sanitation worker’s testimony.

Chilling details about victims

The former sanitation worker, who worked for the Dharmasthala temple administration between 1995 and 2014, has revealed some chilling details relating to the murder victims that he claims to have buried. He said that in 2010, he was forced to bury a school girl, aged 12-15 years, near a petrol bunk in Kalleri. He added that the girl was wearing a school uniform, but her skirt and undergarments were missing, and her body bore marks of sexual assault and strangulation.

Talking about another victim, the former sanitation worker recalled that she was a 20-year-old woman whose face was burned with acid, and her body was wrapped in newspapers. He said that he was instructed to burn her body using diesel. He revealed that he had instructed to bury some of the bodies on the bank of the Netravathi River so that the bodies would not be detected and decompose fast due to the damp soil.

He alleged that he was forced to bury or burn the dead bodies of all those victims and was threatened with death if he did not comply. He said that he fled Dharmasthala in December 2014 after a minor girl in his family was sexually assaulted by someone connected to his supervisors. After fleeing, he spent many years in hiding in neighbouring states. He claimed that he had returned because of a deep sense of guilt and that he needed closure. “If the bodies that are being exhumed are given a proper funeral, the souls of those who have suffered will find peace and my sense of guilt will also be reduced… I believe the deceased deserves a respectful farewell…” he said in his complaint.

He has sought protection under the Witness Protection Act, 2018 and offered to cooperate in the investigation of the case by identifying the burial sites and the names of the culprits.

Sujata Bhatt said that her daughter Ananya Bhatt, a medical student from Manipal, went missing in 2003 after visiting Dharmasthala. When she visited the place in search of her daughter, locals said that they saw the girl with some temple officials. However, when she approached the police, her complaint was ignored. After that she was abducted by three man, and was assaulted rendering her unconscious. She said that she woke up in a Bengaluru hospital 3 months later.

Despite being an employee at CBI, she didn’t get any support from authorities. She has now demanded DNA analysis of the discovered skeletons to identify the body of her daughter.",latest development dharmasthala mass burial case karnataka government ordered formation sit headed director general police internal security division pronab mohanty 19th july assisted deputy inspector general police recruitment n anucheth ip officer soumyalatha k jitendra kumar dayama according ambika secretary government home department government ordered formation sit comprehensive investigation case sit formed state commission woman called sit probe allegation relating discovery numerous human skeleton dharmasthala karnataka 14th july chairperson karnataka state commission woman wrote letter seeking investigation led senior police officer case missing female student woman unnatural death murder rape reported last two decade related criminal case reported police station across state transferred sit background case case caught attention unknown man later turned former sanitation worker employed lord manjunatha shrine dharmasthala filed complaint police claiming forced bury dead body woman minor girl dharmsthala complaint followed another complaint filed woman named sujatha whose daughter gone missing trip pilgrimage town dharmasthala former sanitation worker arrives court give testimony june 3 2025 former sanitation worker submitted complaint police accompanied photo evidence skeletal remains complaint former sanitation worker claimed forced bury hundred body murder victim including woman young girl many sexually assaulted 1998 2014 “many female body without clothing underwear bore clear sign sexual assault violence wound strangulation indicated violence… 100 woman including student raped murdered buried… ” wrote former sanitation worker complaint week filing complaint former sanitation worker appeared court covered head toe conceal identity testify allegation made complaint claimed culprit influential people linked temple administration complaint followed another complaint filed 15th july sujatha mother first year mbbs student named ananya bhat went missing 2003 college trip dharmasthala 60 year old sujatha belief daughter might among victim mentioned former sanitation worker’s testimony chilling detail victim former sanitation worker worked dharmasthala temple administration 1995 2014 revealed chilling detail relating murder victim claim buried said 2010 forced bury school girl aged 12 15 year near petrol bunk kalleri added girl wearing school uniform skirt undergarment missing body bore mark sexual assault strangulation talking another victim former sanitation worker recalled 20 year old woman whose face burned acid body wrapped newspaper said instructed burn body using diesel revealed instructed bury body bank netravathi river body would detected decompose fast due damp soil alleged forced bury burn dead body victim threatened death comply said fled dharmasthala december 2014 minor girl family sexually assaulted someone connected supervisor fleeing spent many year hiding neighbouring state claimed returned deep sense guilt needed closure “if body exhumed given proper funeral soul suffered find peace sense guilt also reduced… believe deceased deserves respectful farewell…” said complaint sought protection witness protection act 2018 offered cooperate investigation case identifying burial site name culprit sujata bhatt said daughter ananya bhatt medical student manipal went missing 2003 visiting dharmasthala visited place search daughter local said saw girl temple official however approached police complaint ignored abducted three man assaulted rendering unconscious said woke bengaluru hospital 3 month later despite employee cbi didn’t get support authority demanded dna analysis discovered skeleton identify body daughter
OpIndia,20/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/children-disabled-elderly-most-vulnerable-victims-stray-dog-attacks/,"Children, disabled and the elderly: The most vulnerable victims of stray dog attacks","In 2024 alone, there were over 37 lakh cases of dog bites reported in India. The real numbers remain unknown as not all dog bite cases are reported. According to reports, around 20% of all bite victims were children. Studies have confirmed that children bear a disproportionate share of the burden of dog bite cases in India. An analysis estimates the number could even be double, at 40%, in rabies-endemic areas. Children are not the only ones who face the danger every day. The elderly, disabled, maids, daily wage workers and delivery partners are among the most affected.

Children often fall victim

On 18th July, a pack of street dogs mauled four-year-old Nithin to death at Rupla Thanda in Shivvampet Mandal of Telangana. The boy was on his way home after buying biscuits from a general store when the dogs attacked him. Nithin sustained serious injuries. Passers-by rescued him and his parents rushed the critically injured child to the government hospital in Narsapur, where doctors declared him brought dead.

Nithin did not die of rabies. He died of the dog bites he sustained during the attack, and this is not an isolated incident. There have been many cases where children have been mauled to death by packs of dogs, and in some cases, even pet dogs have killed children on streets without any provocation.

In May this year, a 4-month-old baby was attacked by a pet Rottweiler in Ahmedabad, Gujarat. Dog lovers often claim that dog attacks are the result of prolonged abuse and attacks by humans. They should explain how a pet dog was attacked and abused by a 4-month-old toddler.

According to media reports, the maternal aunt of the baby girl took her out into the common garden of the housing society. At the same time, the owner of the Rottweiler was out with the dog while talking on the phone. The dog got aggressive for no reason and attacked the infant. The aunt and the infant were just sitting near the garden with others when the attack happened. It took seconds for the aggressive dog to maul the infant, who succumbed to injuries later in the hospital. The aunt also sustained serious injuries. Reportedly, the toddler sustained deep injuries on the neck and skull. How is this attack justified? How are the dog lovers, animal activists, judiciary and lawmakers going to justify allowing such breeds in the country?

Coming back to stray dogs, they commonly attack unsupervised children at play or when they are alone on the streets. Children’s smaller stature and curiosity make them easy targets. There are hundreds of reports where dogs have attacked school-age children. Children often become easy targets in different scenarios. For example, if children are playing near uncollected garbage that is frequently surrounded by hungry packs, dogs are going to attack the children one day or another.

To stop stray dog attacks on children, in July 2024, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs advised schools and parks to implement National Commission for Protection of Child Rights guidelines aimed at preventing attacks on children. However, despite the guidelines, the ground reality is in complete contrast, and child casualties continue to mount.

Disabled people face heightened risk

People with disabilities, especially sensory impairments, are extremely vulnerable to stray dog attacks. Mobility or vision limitations make it next to impossible for them to detect and avoid nearby dogs, and everyday aids can unintentionally provoke the stray dogs. For example, a visually impaired person uses a cane to walk, which can easily aggravate a pack of stray dogs, leading to an attack.

Persons with disabilities are far more prone to attacks, injuries and death by stray dogs as they are often unable to see, hear or avoid being attacked. On campuses and in markets, persons with disabilities may stumble over resting dogs, leading to an attack. For example, a first-year law student with 65% cerebral palsy in Odisha was chased repeatedly by packs of strays inside college grounds, which caused severe anxiety and health issues. In another case, an 11-year-old boy with a speech impairment from Kerala was mauled to death by a pack of stray dogs and he could not cry out for help.

Notably, these dangers have not gone unnoticed. The Odisha High Court in 2024 upheld the fundamental right of disabled persons and ordered to remove the dogs from the law college premises. Activists working for the rights of disabled persons have argued that current no-kill dog policies that mandate the return of sterilised dogs to the street violate disability rights under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.

In 2024, a PIL noted that India’s Animal Birth Control rules did not address the special danger faced by disabled people in public spaces. In short, lack of sight, sound or quick reflexes leaves many disabled individuals virtually defenceless against stray dogs. Delhi High Court, while hearing the PIL, noted, “The city has been taken over; nowhere in the world will you find a whole city taken over by dogs and monkeys. Today it is impossible to walk on the main streets.”

A practical solution for such issues would be designated no-dog zones, especially around schools for the blind, and legal liability for dog feeders. However, it appears that for dog lovers, dog feeders and animal activists, persons with disabilities virtually do not exist, as they keep on pushing for letting the stray dogs have the first right on the streets, and not humans.

Elderly people are also vulnerable

Frailer limbs, slower reflexes and a vulnerable state of mind make older adults easy targets of stray dogs. Multiple news reports have described how easily such individuals become a target. In Pune, an 88-year-old woman was bedridden after she was bitten multiple times by a stray dog that wandered into her home. In Aligarh, a pack of six stray dogs mauled an elderly man to death in a university park. The severity of these incidents is striking. In the Pune case, the woman was bitten on the face and hands.

Why are older people at risk? Many elderly individuals live alone or are cared for outdoors, for example, doing domestic work or walking for exercise. They may not notice a dog approaching and once they are on the ground, it is virtually impossible for them to scramble away. Even a non-fatal attack can leave an older person with serious injuries or trauma.

Older bite victims also run a higher risk of complications, including infection, as they may have other health conditions and are less likely to access immediate care, especially if they are living alone. The pattern is clear, stray dog packs tend to prey on the least mobile and least able to fend off an attack.

Despite clear precedent allowing removal of dangerous dogs under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, the current ABC Rules make it practically impossible to permanently remove even repeat-offender dogs. Speaking to OpIndia, legal activist Muralidharan Shivalingam notes, “Nowhere do the Rules say dogs can’t be removed or euthanised. But that’s how they’re enforced, thanks to decades of misinformation and pressure tactics by powerful lobbies.”

Poor and working-class victims

A significant majority of bite victims are from economically weaker backgrounds. Daily wage earners, delivery workers, sanitation staff and house helps often fall victim to stray dog, as well as pet dog attacks. For instance, a Swiggy agent in Hyderabad died after leaping from a building to escape an aggressive dog that belonged to a customer. In Raipur, pit bulls mauled a delivery rider at a customer’s house. Rickshaw pullers, vendors and sanitation workers frequently report bites, but often avoid hospitals due to wage loss or unaffordability of vaccines.

Another activist, Ryan Lobo, spoke to OpIndia and cited a WHO-supported study from 2004 that estimates that over 75% of dog bite victims in India are from poor or marginalised communities. Yet, ironically, it is these very communities who are the least represented in the courtrooms or policymaking bodies defending the “rights” of stray dogs. Not to forget, a 4-month-old child was eaten by a stray dog while the child’s parents were working at a construction site nearby.

A policy designed for paralysis

Animal Birth Control (ABC) Rules, originally notified in 2001 and updated in 2023, mandate that stray dogs must be captured, sterilised, vaccinated and released in the same area. This policy, activists have argued, is fundamentally flawed.

The ABC Rules are subordinate legislation under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act. However, as Ryan explains, “They are written through the lens of animal rights, not animal welfare. Globally, dog control is focused on ownership and accountability. In India, we have made street dogs a state-maintained hazard.”

Moreover, governments, both central and local, are spending crores on implementation of ABC Rules, but the number of strays remains unchecked. There are over 7 crore stray dogs in India, a number that should be more than enough to shake the lawmakers, but nothing is happening, thanks to the ABC Rules. Even in areas with high sterilisation coverage, new dogs quickly migrate in, filling the void. Feeding zones mandated under ABC further encourage this cycle.

Health threats beyond rabies

While rabies garners the most attention, fatal and life-altering outcomes from the sheer violence of dog bites and mauling incidents, without any rabies infection, are disturbingly common and deserve equal concern. Leptospirosis, campylobacter and other zoonotic diseases linked to dog faeces spike during monsoons. Contaminated water systems, open defecation by dogs and lack of routine veterinary screening contribute to these outbreaks. As Ryan points out, “Swachh Bharat succeeded in curbing human open defecation. But disease burdens haven’t reduced, because dog faeces in urban areas remains unchecked.”

Legal confusion, activist pressure and foreign funding

It has been made clear by the judiciary that stray dog management is a state subject. The governments are free to take decisions to protect human life. However, local bodies often hesitate, fearing litigation. Many NGOs file PILs within hours of any municipal action, armed with high-profile lawyers and backed by opaque foreign funds. In conversation with OpIndia, Muralidharan highlighted that ABC Rules were “written without jurisdiction”. Enforcement of these rules is based mostly on fear, not law.

Conclusion – Human rights must come first

India cannot claim to be a civilised, developing nation while it continues to allow its weakest citizens, children, the elderly, disabled and poor, to be regularly injured or killed by an unmanaged stray dog population. No law or rule justifies this breakdown of the state’s duty to protect.

Vaccinating and sterilising dogs is not enough if dangerous ones are allowed to remain on the streets. True animal welfare must walk hand-in-hand with public safety. And as Ryan bluntly noted, “A sterilised dog can still kill.”

OpIndia,20/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/around-51-lakh-voters-to-be-removed-from-bihar-voter-list-as-eci-finds-major-discrepancies/,"Around 51 lakh voters to be removed from Bihar voter list as ECI finds major discrepancies in SIR exercise due to duplicate entries, death...","The Election Commission of India (ECI) has found major differences in the voter roll of Bihar through a special verification campaign referred to as the Special Intensive Revision (SIR). The ECI reported that approximately 18 lakh enrolled voters have died, 26 lakh have shifted, and 7 lakh names are duplicates.

The ECI revealed that nearly 97.30% of Bihar’s total 7.89 crore voters have completed the enumeration forms till now. That is more than 7.68 crore voters have already replied.

Officers such as the Chief Electoral Officer (CEO), District Election Officers (DEOs), Electoral Registration Officers (EROs), and Booth Level Officers (BLOs) are coordinating with political party workers to sanitize the voters’ list. The ECI has also published a list of 21.36 lakh voters whose forms are yet to be submitted, and approximately 52.30 lakh names of individuals who are deceased, have migrated permanently, or are listed in more than one location.

The ECI further stated that the BLOs and EROs are providing detailed lists of such voters to all political parties so that the process remains transparent. The people will be allowed a complete one-month period in order to object to or make corrections on names being added or removed from the voter list.

Opposition raises concerns

But the Opposition is strongly criticising this exercise. Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has charged the NDA alliance with attempting to delete names of people from the voter roll. She complained that voter rolls were inflated in Maharashtra elections, and now, voters are being deleted in Bihar in the guise of revision.

She stated, “Earlier, in Maharashtra, votes were tampered with by padding electoral rolls. Now, in Bihar, efforts are being made to do the same by deleting voters’ names. The ‘vote ban’ under the pretext of SIR is a plot to grab the right to vote given by the Constitution. We oppose every attempt to crush the Constitution.”

SIR exercise in Bihar

The Special Intensive Revision (SIR) is being conducted in Bihar to revise the voters’ lists for the upcoming assembly elections in the state. This kind of intensive revision occurred in the state for the last time in 2003. Due to changes such as urban migration, fatalities, new young voters, and the problem of illegal immigrants, a new verification became necessary.

BLOs have been designated to go to houses and ensure the rolls are correct. The objective is straightforward: to register all legitimate voters, eliminate illegitimate ones, and maintain transparency in the procedure.

The elections for the Bihar Assembly are scheduled later in the year sometime around October or November, but the official release date has not been declared yet.

OpIndia,20/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/1-29-lakh-bigha-land-occupied-by-bangladeshi-infiltrators-and-doubtful-citizens-freed-in-4-years-informs-assam-cm-himanta-biswa-sarma/,"1.29 lakh bigha land occupied by Bangladeshi infiltrators and doubtful citizens freed in 4 years, informs Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma","Chief Minister of Assam, Himanta Biswa Sarma stated that around 29 lakh bighas (nearly 10 lakh acres) of land in Assam is reported to be occupied by “Bangladeshi infiltrators and doubtful citizens.” He mentioned that after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government took office in 2021, a campaign was initiated to reclaim the property but they encountered international pressure to cease these actions.

He made the shocking disclosures on 21st July during a function commemorating the fourth anniversary of the Multipurpose Agricultural Project at Garukhuti in the Darang district.

This project commenced in 2021, and to date, 77,420 bighas of land (25,500 acres) have been cleared of encroachments.

“Today, the land in Garukhuti, once occupied illegally, has been converted into productive agricultural fields. This is the model we aim to replicate across encroached areas in Assam,” he conveyed.

In the last 4 years, we have freed over 42,000 acres of land from encroachers and dedicated it to public use. pic.twitter.com/AaWDKMcNTK — Himanta Biswa Sarma (@himantabiswa) July 21, 2025

According to media reports, Sarma remarked, “After the successful execution of the campaign in the Darang district, the initiative was also extended to Borsola, Lumding, Burhapahar, Pabha, Batadrava, Chapar and Paikan. In the last four years, we have reclaimed 1.29 lakh bigha (around 43,000 acres) of occupied land. A considerable portion of it is now being allocated for forest development and the citizens of the state.”

He declared, “If anyone believes that after two or three campaigns we will be intimidated, not confront them directly and bow down, they are mistaken. The martyrs of the Assam Movement will certainly be avenged.” He mentioned that during the Assam Movement from 1983 to 1985, there was a prevailing sense of defeat and many individuals had “surrendered” to the Congress which changed the political trajectory of the state.

Shankar-Madhav became Shankar-Azan

Sarma pointed out that, at a certain point, we started referring to Shankar-Madhav as Shankar-Azan. Azan Peer will continue to maintain his pivotal role, yet Madhav (Madhavdev) also has his own significant position. It is only then that our “caste” can be preserved. Srimanta Sankardev and Sri Sri Madhavdev are esteemed Vaishnav saints in Assam whereas Azan Peer was a Muslim sage who arrived there from Iraq during the 17th century.

Over 1000 bighas of land cleared in Goalpara

The Himanta government is actively involved in measures to safeguard the state’s demographic composition. As part of the drive, encroached lands have been reclaimed in various locations. On 12th July, an eviction operation took place in the Paikan Reserve Forest located in the Goalpara district. 140 hectares (equivalent to 1038 to 1040 bighas) of forest land had been unlawfully taken over predominantly by Muslims.

Tejas Mariswamy, the Divisional Forest Officer of Goalpara outlined that 1,080 families had built houses in this area. The majority of these individuals were Muslims who had migrated from adjacent regions or Bangladesh. A total of 36 bulldozers were utilized during the action and the region was divided into 6 distinct blocks. Nearly 2,500 to 2,700 structures, including houses and shops were dismantled. Over 1,000 police officers and forest guards were deployed for security purposes.

Mamata Banerjee cries “atrocities on Bengalis”

A war of words broke out on social media between Sarma and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee over the removal of infiltrators and illegal occupation in Assam. She complained that the administration is persecuting the Bengali community in Assam by singling them out, labeling it as the BJP’s divisive agenda.

However, Sarma responded that it is not the Bengalis but rather Muslim infiltrators who are being expelled from Assam. He also referenced a statement from the Supreme Court which characterized infiltration as an external invasion.",chief minister assam himanta biswa sarma stated around 29 lakh bighas nearly 10 lakh acre land assam reported occupied “bangladeshi infiltrator doubtful citizen ” mentioned bharatiya janata party bjp government took office 2021 campaign initiated reclaim property encountered international pressure cease action made shocking disclosure 21st july function commemorating fourth anniversary multipurpose agricultural project garukhuti darang district project commenced 2021 date 77 420 bighas land 25 500 acre cleared encroachment “today land garukhuti occupied illegally converted productive agricultural field model aim replicate across encroached area assam ” conveyed last 4 year freed 42 000 acre land encroacher dedicated public use pic twitter com aawdkmcntk — himanta biswa sarma himantabiswa july 21 2025 according medium report sarma remarked “after successful execution campaign darang district initiative also extended borsola lumding burhapahar pabha batadrava chapar paikan last four year reclaimed 1 29 lakh bigha around 43 000 acre occupied land considerable portion allocated forest development citizen state ” declared “if anyone belief two three campaign intimidated confront directly bow mistaken martyr assam movement certainly avenged ” mentioned assam movement 1983 1985 prevailing sense defeat many individual “surrendered” congress changed political trajectory state shankar madhav became shankar azan sarma pointed certain point started referring shankar madhav shankar azan azan peer continue maintain pivotal role yet madhav madhavdev also significant position “caste” preserved srimanta sankardev sri sri madhavdev esteemed vaishnav saint assam whereas azan peer muslim sage arrived iraq 17th century 1000 bighas land cleared goalpara himanta government actively involved measure safeguard state’s demographic composition part drive encroached land reclaimed various location 12th july eviction operation took place paikan reserve forest located goalpara district 140 hectare equivalent 1038 1040 bighas forest land unlawfully taken predominantly muslim tejas mariswamy divisional forest officer goalpara outlined 1 080 family built house area majority individual muslim migrated adjacent region bangladesh total 36 bulldozer utilized action region divided 6 distinct block nearly 2 500 2 700 structure including house shop dismantled 1 000 police officer forest guard deployed security purpose mamata banerjee cry “atrocities bengalis” war word broke social medium sarma west bengal chief minister mamata banerjee removal infiltrator illegal occupation assam complained administration persecuting bengali community assam singling labeling bjp’s divisive agenda however sarma responded bengali rather muslim infiltrator expelled assam also referenced statement supreme court characterized infiltration external invasion

The resignation came on the opening day of the Monsoon Session of Parliament, catching many by surprise amid a busy legislative agenda. Speculations are rife about the timing of Dhankhar’s resignation, with the opposition claiming that the reasons behind his stepping down may be far deeper than just health reasons.

In his letter to President Droupadi Murmu, Jagdeep Dhankhar invoked Article 67(a) of the Constitution to make his resignation effective immediately. Citing ongoing health challenges, he stated his intention to “prioritise health care and abide by medical advice.”

From the very onset in 2022, Dhankhar’s tenure as Vice President was marked by his vocal criticism of the judiciary, especially on the issues of its overreach and accountability. Being a seasoned lawyer himself and having a background in the Supreme Court and the Rajasthan High Court, Jagdeep Dhankhar consistently raised concerns over the alleged encroachment of the powers of the legislature and executive by the judiciary, arguing that their actions undermined the supremacy of Parliament and the balance of powers as prescribed in the Constitution.

“Judiciary cannot become executive”: When Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar warned the judiciary that its overreach might destabilise governance

Hitting back at the judiciary regarding the overturning of parliamentary amendments to the Constitution in December 2022, VP Jagdeep Dhankhar warned that the judiciary cannot become the legislative or the executive because doing so may destabilise the system of government as a whole.

Dhankhar stated during the eighth LM Singhvi memorial lecture that our judiciary, as one of the important institutions of government, cannot be the executive or legislative.

“The doctrine of separation of power is fundamental to our governance. Any incursion, howsoever subtle, in the domain of the other by one has the capacity or potential to unsettle the apple cart of governance,” then vice president stated.

“India in 2015-16 was dealing with a constitutional amendment act and as a matter of record the entire Lok Sabha voted unanimously and there was no abstention in Lok Sabha and that amendment act was passed. In Rajya Sabha, there was no opposition. We the people their ordainment came to be reflected through the most sanctified mechanisms through the applicable mechanisms. That power was undone. The world does not know of any such instance. I appeal to all judicial minds please think of a parallel in the world where a constitutional provision can be undone,” the vice president stated.

In the presence of then Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud, several Supreme Court judges, Union Ministers, then Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and several lawyers, Dhankhar further said, “Power resides in ‘We the People’ – their mandate, their wisdom… If a constitutional provision that carries the ordainment of the people at large in such a vibrant democracy is undone, what will happen? I appeal to the people here, they constitute a judicial elite class, thinking minds, intellectuals – please find out a parallel in the world where a constitutional provision can be undone.”

He also asserted that while the Indian Constitution clearly states in Article 145(3) that the court may interpret the Constitution where a serious question of law is involved. “Nowhere it say a provision can be run down.”

When VP Jagdeep Dhankhar came down heavily on the Supreme Court for scrapping the NJAC

Back in December 2022, Dhankhar criticised the Supreme Court over the 99th Constitutional Amendment Bill paving way for the National Judicial Appointment Commission (NJAC), which was undone by the Supreme Court in 2015.

“The Parliament in a much-needed historic step passed the 99th Constitutional Amendment Bill, paving the way for the National Judicial Appointment Commission (NJAC). There was unprecedented support for the above. On August 13, 2014, the Lok Sabha unanimously voted in its favour with there being no abstentions. This House too, passed it unanimously on August 14, 2014, with one abstention. Rarely in Parliamentary democracy, there has been such massive support to a Constitutional legislation,” Dhankhar said.

“This process fructified into a Constitutional prescription, after 16 State Assemblies out of 29 States ratified the Central Legislation; the President of India, in terms of Article 111, accorded his consent on December 31, 2014,” he added.

Furthermore, then Vice President, Jagdeep Dhankhar stated that this was the first time that a duly legitimised constitutional prescription was judicially undone, “This historic parliamentary mandate was undone by the Supreme Court on October 16, 2015 by a majority of 4:1 finding the same as not being in consonance with the judicially evolved doctrine of ‘Basic Structure’ of the Constitution,” said.

Dhankhar had called the scrapping of the NJAC a severe compromise of parliamentary sovereignty and disregard of the mandate of the people, of which this house and the Lok Sabha are custodians.

VP Dhankhar had also emphasised that Parliament is the exclusive and ultimate determinative of the architecture of the Constitution.

“We need to bear in mind that in democratic governance, the basis of any ‘Basic Structure’ is the prevalence of primacy of the mandate of the people reflected in the Parliament. Parliament is the exclusive and ultimate determinative of the architecture of the Constitution,” said.

It must be recalled that back in 2014, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government brought the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) Act in an attempt to change the system of appointment of judges. The NJAC was a proposed body, which would have been responsible for the appointment and transfer of judges to the higher judiciary. The NJAC Act and the Constitutional Amendment Act came into force on April 13, 2015. But the top court on October 16, 2015, struck down the NJAC Act. The verdict brought back the primacy of the collegium system of judges appointing judges.

VP Jagdeep Dhankhar differed from Supreme Court’s idea of ‘basic structure’ doctrine

In January 2023, Dhankhar once again reignited the discussion over the doctrine of the separation of powers. This time, he cited the Supreme Court’s landmark judgment in the 1973 Kesavanand Bharati case wherein the court had ruled that while Parliament had the authority to amend the Constitution, it cannot amend its basic structure.

Delivering his inaugural address at the 83rd All-India Presiding Officers Conference in Jaipur, Jagdeep Dhankhar questioned: “Are we a democratic nation?”

Asserting that all three pillars of democracy: legislature, executive and judiciary must function within their limits, then Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar said, “In a democratic society, the basis of any basic structure is supremacy of the people, sovereignty of the people, sovereignty of Parliament. Executive thrives on the sovereignty of Parliament. Legislatures and Parliament decide who will be the Chief Minister, who will be the Prime Minister. The ultimate power is with the Legislature. The Legislature decides who will be in other institutions. In such a situation, all Constitutional institutions – the Legislative, Executive, Judiciary – are required to be within their limits.”

Expressing his disagreement over the Supreme Court ruling in the Kesavanand Bharati case that the Parliament cannot amend the constitution’s basic structure, Dhankhar said, “In 1973, in the Kesavananda Bharati case, the Supreme Court gave the idea of basic structure, saying that Parliament can amend the Constitution, but not its basic structure. With due respect to the Judiciary, I cannot subscribe to this.”

‘Time has come to revisit’: When Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar questioned the involvement of the CJI in executive appointments

In February 2025, Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar questioned how the judiciary can be involved in executive appointments as the Supreme Court of India was hearing a petition seeking to include the Chief Justice of India in the selection committee for the Election Commission. He said while earlier the executive yielded to the inclusion of judges in executive functions, it was time to revisit the norms.

Speaking at the National Judicial Academy, Bhopal, Dhankhar said that such a system should not exist in a democracy like India. He wondered how the Chief Justice of India participates in the selection of the CBI director, even by “statutory prescription”.

The vice president said, “To stir your minds, how can in a country like ours or in any democracy, by statutory prescription, the Chief Justice of India participate in the selection of the CBI director! Can there be any legal rationale for it? I can appreciate that the statutory prescription took shape because the Executive of the day has yielded to a judicial verdict. But time has come to revisit.”

Jagdeep Dhankhar further said, “This surely does not merge with democracy. How can we involve the Chief Justice of India in any executive appointment?”

Dhankhar went on to say that while the Supreme Court has the power to interpret the constitution, there can be no “arrogation of authority” under the guise of interpretation. The essence and spirit which the founding fathers had in mind under Article 145(3) must be respected.”

He further advocated for an increase in the constitutional bench strength, as originally the constitution bench comprised the majority of total judges.

“When the strength of the Supreme Court was eight judges, under Article 145(3), there was a stipulation that interpretation of the Constitution would be by a bench of five judges or more. Please note, when this strength was eight, it was five. And the Constitution allows the highest court of the land to interpret the Constitution. If I analyse arithmetically, they were very sure the interpretation will be by the majority of judges, because the strength then was eight. That five stands as it is. And the number (of total judges) is more than fourfold,” he said.

VP Dhankhar’s advocacy for including domain experts in arbitral process instead of retired judges

In March 2025, Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar said that the arbitral process in India is “just an additional burden to the normal hierarchical mechanism of adjudication.”

Addressing the Colloquium organised by the India International Arbitration Centre (IIAC) at Bharat Mandapam, Dhankhar said, “Arbitrators play as much critical role as members of the bar associated with the arbiter process. Surprisingly, there is, I’m saying it with utmost restraint, absolute tight-fist control of a segment of a category that is involved with arbiter process determination. This tight-fist control emanates out of judicial feats. And if we examine it on an objective platform, it is excruciatingly painful.”

Emphasising the significance of Article 136 and its effects on the arbitration process, Dhankhar said that while Article 136 was supposed to be a narrow slit, it is hurting the arbitral process.

“The Attorney General of the country can really reflect and make a big change. Which country in the world, Attorney, tell me, has suo moto cognisance by the highest court? I’m sure I can’t look around. And Article 136 intervention was supposed to be a narrow-slit. The wall has been demolished with anything and everything under the sun, including what a magistrate has to do, what a Session Judge has to do, what a District Judge has to do, and what a High Court Judge has to do. That wall demolition is also hurting the arbitral process. All I am suggesting, in all humility and as a concerned citizen of this country, is that the issue you are debating is critical to micro and small industries. They want a facile, easy arbitral process”.

Jagdeep Dhankhar condemned Supreme Court’s “judicial overreach”, calling it an unelected ‘super Parliament’

In April 2025, VP Jagdeep Dhankhar harshly criticised the recent Supreme Court verdict regarding the powers of the Governor and the President under Articles 200 and 201 of the Constitution. In the Judgment passed on 8th April 2025, a division bench of the Supreme Court set a time limit, not envisaged in the Constitution, on the exercise of power to grant or refuse assent to a state Bill by the President and the Governor. The Supreme Court prescribed a deadline of 3 months on the President’s power to grant or refuse assent to a Bill reserved by the Governor for his consideration.

Without mincing words, VP Dhankhar questioned the Supreme Court for issuing a direction to the President of India. He reminded the Supreme Court that its power is limited to interpreting the Constitution. “We cannot have a situation where you direct the President of India, and on what basis? The only right you have under the Constitution is to interpret the Constitution under Article 145(3), ” said the Vice President in an address during the Valedictory Function of the 6th Rajya Sabha Internship Program at Vice-President’s Enclave on 17th April.

“The President is called upon to decide in a time-bound manner, and if not, it becomes law. So we have judges who will legislate, who will perform executive functions, who will act as super-parliament, and absolutely have no accountability because the law of the land does not apply to them,” he said.

Highlighting the fact that the judgment, which had the effect of modifying the concerned provisions, was delivered by a bench of two judges which did not represent the majority of the total number of judges in the Supreme Court.

“When Article 145(3) was there, the number of judges in the Supreme Court was eight, 5 out of 8, now 5 out of 30 and odd. But forget about it, the judges who issued a mandamus virtually to the President and presented a scenario that it will be the law of the land, have forgotten the power of the Constitution. How can that combination of judges deal with something under Article 145(3) if preserved, it was then for five out of eight. We need to make amends for that also now. Five out of eight would mean interpretation will be by majority. Well, five constitutes more than the majority in eight. But leave that aside. Article 142 has become a nuclear missile against Democratic forces, available to the judiciary 24 x 7,” Dhankhar said.

Notably, in the verdict passed in The State of Tamil Nadu v The Governor of Tamil Nadu and Anr, the Apex Court examined the ambit of powers of the President and the Governor conferred under Articles 200 and 201 of the Constitution. The Supreme Court held that the President should decide on the Bills sent to him by the Governor for consideration within 3 months, and that any delay beyond the prescribed time limit should be justified by recording reasons. Besides, the Court ruled that if the President fails to decide on a Bill within 3 months, then the State government can seek the issuance of the writ of mandamus from the Supreme Court against the President. The judgment has been widely criticised for alleged judicial overreach or a judicial attempt to effectively amend the constitution.

Dhankhar questioned the handling of the Justice Yashwant Varma case

Former Vice-President Dhankhar had also raised questions on how the Supreme Court handled the matter relating to the discovery of huge amounts of unaccounted cash at the house of Justice Yashwant Varma. “An event happened on the night of the 14th and 15th of March in New Delhi, at the residence of a judge. For seven days, no one knew about it. We have to ask questions to ourselves. Is the delay explainable? Condonable? Does it not raise certain fundamental questions? In any ordinary situation, and ordinary situations define the rule of law, things would have been different. It was only on 21st March, disclosed by a newspaper, that people of the country were shocked as never before, ” the Vice-President remarked.

🚨 HUGE! Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar raises ALARM on JUDICIAL CORRUPTION

“I support judicial independence — but ACCOUNTABILITY IS KEY.” pic.twitter.com/THpUDUe6aO — Megh Updates 🚨™ (@MeghUpdates) July 7, 2025

“Thereafter, fortunately, in the public domain, we had input from an authoritative source, the Supreme Court of India. And the input indicated culpability. Input did not lead to doubt that something was amiss. Something requires to be investigated. Now the nation waits with bated breath. The nation is restive because one of our institutions, to which people have always looked up with the highest respect and deference, was put in the dock,” he added.

Jagdeep Dhankhar: The man who questioned judicial overreach, sought accountability and advocated for balance of powers even in the face of backlash from the opposition and slandering by the leftist ecosystem

Dhankhar’s fierce critiques of what he deemed judicial overreach and encroachment of the powers of the legislature were not without pushback. Beyond the insulting mimicries, several opposition leaders labelled Dhankhar as ‘non-neutral’ and his comments slamming the judiciary ‘unconstitutional’. The opposition parties and the leftist media cabal even accused the former VP of ‘undermining’ judicial independence. Not to forget, the leftist propaganda portal The Wire went as far as to call Dhankhar a “partisan attack dog” over VP Dhankhar’s criticism of the Supreme Court for using Article 142 and calling it a “nuclear missile against democratic forces”.

Despite the slandering, mockery and criticism, Dhankhar did not shy away from raising concern over judicial overreach, particularly in matters involving a delicate balance of power among the judiciary, executive and legislature. Even in the judge Yaswant Varma case, Jagdeep Dhankhar publicly questioned the actions of the Supreme Court, raising concerns regarding accountability in a democracy wherein elected representatives are subject to scrutiny but judges are nearly immune to all sorts of accountability and scrutiny.

While the opposition and the leftist media ecosystem accused VP Dhankhar of delivering politically charged rhetoric at the behest of his ‘political masters’, the BJP, VP Dhankhar’s remarks were not politically charged or at odds with his constitutional duty, rather, his criticism of the judiciary was driven by a genuine concern over a pattern wherein the judiciary seems to be discharging the duties of President, and at times those of the Parliament as well.

Dhankhar’s courage, however, has not been surprising as even during his tenure as the governor of West Bengal, he repeatedly raised concern over post-poll violence in the state and severely criticised the TMC government for the Birbhum massacre. He remained at loggerheads with the CM Mamata Banerjee-led state government over issues pertaining to federalism and governance, condemning the near-collapse of democracy in the state.

While the opposition and its media cheerleaders mocked Jagdeep Dhankhar, belittled the importance of the Vice President’s post and projected the judiciary as somewhat sacrosanct to criticism, even moved a failed impeachment motion, Jagdeep Dhankhar stood his ground, not for personal gains, not for clout, not for political leverage, but for democracy, for constitution and the supremacy of the people’s mandate.

Several parliamentarians had earlier also raised concerns over judicial activism and overreach; however, Dhankhar’s interventions brought the debate to the forefront, triggering the judiciary, lawmakers and the public to ponder over the question of the judiciary’s role in a healthy democracy.

Jagdeep Dhankhar’s tenure as the Vice President of India and Rajya Sabha chairman will be remembered for many good reasons, especially his role as a defender of constitutional balance.

OpIndia,20/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/first-balasore-self-immolation-now-greater-noida-suicide-the-problem-of-harassment-of-students/,"First Balasore self-immolation, now Greater Noida suicide: Why do we need such tragedies to wake us up to the problem of harassment of students","Jyoti Sharma, a second-year student from Sharda University in Greater Noida, pursuing BDS, died by suicide in her hostel room. She passed away on July 18, Friday, reportedly after writing a suicide note. The note accuses two professors and the university administration of mental harassment. The two staff members, Mahinder and Shairy, have been arrested so far.

In the suicide letter, she wrote that she had been mentally harassed and humiliated for a long time, which caused her significant distress. She expressed her desire for the accused to face legal action. She held the teachers of PCP and Dental Materials responsible for her death.

The note reads, “They mentally harassed me. They humiliated me. I have been under stress because of them for a long time. I want them to face the same thing. I am sorry. I can’t live like this anymore. I can’t…”

Shortly after the incident came to light, students gathered and protested against the university administration, alleging negligence. They claimed Jyoti had been under immense stress due to accusations of forging signatures. A minor scuffle broke out between the protesters and the police, while the family of the deceased was seen manhandling the head of the dentistry department.

The incident occurred on Friday night, and a case has been filed at the Knowledge Park Police Station in Gautam Buddha Nagar. “The woman’s body has been sent for post-mortem, and two staff members of the university have been arrested on the basis of a complaint filed by the victim’s family,” said Additional DCP of Greater Noida, Sudhir Kumar.

He added that tension had escalated due to the anger among the deceased’s family and university students towards the administration. The anger and scuffle were defused by the police through dialogue, and peace was restored at the scene. Further legal proceedings are underway.

Dr. Ajit Kumar, the university’s Public Relations Officer, confirmed that two faculty members have been suspended. “For now, two teachers have been suspended. A committee has also been formed to investigate the matter. Action will be taken against those found guilty based on the committee’s report,” he stated.

This is not an isolated case of a student taking her life due to harassment. A similar incident took place in Odisha’s Balasore shocking self-immolation case on July 12. A 20-year-old girl set herself on fire, allegedly after enduring sexual harassment by the head of her college department. She suffered 90 percent burns and later succumbed to her injuries at AIIMS Bhubaneswar on July 14.

These brutal incidents show no discrimination based on gender or age. This was evident in the tragic case of a teenager from The Global Public School in Kerala who ended his life after reportedly being bullied, assaulted, and harassed by his schoolmates.

According to the teenager’s mother, on January 15, he was forcibly taken to the toilet and made to lick the seat; his head was then pushed into the toilet while it was flushed. He was also bullied for his skin tone. The relentless harassment severely affected his mental health, ultimately driving him to end his life by jumping from the 26th floor of their apartment building.

On April 30, 2023, a 16-year-old boy died by suicide after allegedly being mentally abused by his principal and faculty members. He purportedly left a suicide note in which he apologized to his parents and elder brothers and urged serious action against those who had harassed him. The boy allegedly died by suicide in Telangana, with his family accusing the college management and certain members of the teaching staff of harassment and holding them responsible for his death, police reported. The student, in his first year of intermediate studies at a private college in Narsingi, Telangana, was found hanging in a classroom by his friends on Tuesday night, April 30.

All these incidents reflect one painful similarity: before taking their own lives, the victims tried to express what they were going through and, in the end, wrote in their suicide notes. Instead of receiving empathy and support from those around them when they spoke up about harassment in educational institutions, their voices were often ignored. Their stories must be heard, and their grievances must be addressed before blaming the victim. Continued ignorance will only lead to more such tragedies unless educational institutions actively work towards providing safe, empathetic, and responsive environments for students.",jyoti sharma second year student sharda university greater noida pursuing bd died suicide hostel room passed away july 18 friday reportedly writing suicide note note accuses two professor university administration mental harassment two staff member mahinder shairy arrested far suicide letter wrote mentally harassed humiliated long time caused significant distress expressed desire accused face legal action held teacher pcp dental material responsible death note read “they mentally harassed humiliated stress long time want face thing sorry can’t live like anymore can’t…” shortly incident came light student gathered protested university administration alleging negligence claimed jyoti immense stress due accusation forging signature minor scuffle broke protester police family deceased seen manhandling head dentistry department incident occurred friday night case filed knowledge park police station gautam buddha nagar “the woman’s body sent post mortem two staff member university arrested basis complaint filed victim’s family ” said additional dcp greater noida sudhir kumar added tension escalated due anger among deceased’s family university student towards administration anger scuffle defused police dialogue peace restored scene legal proceeding underway dr ajit kumar university’s public relation officer confirmed two faculty member suspended “for two teacher suspended committee also formed investigate matter action taken found guilty based committee’s report ” stated isolated case student taking life due harassment similar incident took place odisha’s balasore shocking self immolation case july 12 20 year old girl set fire allegedly enduring sexual harassment head college department suffered 90 percent burn later succumbed injury aiims bhubaneswar july 14 brutal incident show discrimination based gender age evident tragic case teenager global public school kerala ended life reportedly bullied assaulted harassed schoolmate according teenager’s mother january 15 forcibly taken toilet made lick seat head pushed toilet flushed also bullied skin tone relentless harassment severely affected mental health ultimately driving end life jumping 26th floor apartment building april 30 2023 16 year old boy died suicide allegedly mentally abused principal faculty member purportedly left suicide note apologized parent elder brother urged serious action harassed boy allegedly died suicide telangana family accusing college management certain member teaching staff harassment holding responsible death police reported student first year intermediate study private college narsingi telangana found hanging classroom friend tuesday night april 30 incident reflect one painful similarity taking life victim tried express going end wrote suicide note instead receiving empathy support around spoke harassment educational institution voice often ignored story must heard grievance must addressed blaming victim continued ignorance lead tragedy unless educational institution actively work towards providing safe empathetic responsive environment student
OpIndia,20/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/truck-still-stuck-collapsed-gambhira-bridge-gujarat-as-media-blames-officials-know-what-happened/,"Truck still stuck on collapsed Gambhira bridge in Gujarat: As media blames officials, Anand district collector shares the real reason with OpIndia","After a part of the Gambhira Bridge connecting Saurashtra region and Central Gujarat collapsed on the morning of 9th July, 2025, a truck which got stuck on the bridge is still hanging there, fifteen days after the incident.

Some media reports based on the interviews of the truck driver and the owner claimed that the officials of the two districts of Anand and Vadodara are denying their accountability, which is causing unnecessary hardships to the truck driver and the owner, who have been running from pillar to post to get the truck removed. Pending EMIs are adding to the worries of the truck driver, who is not even able to claim the insurance.

A report in Divya Bhaskar quoted truck owner Ramashankar Pal as saying, ” The officials of the Anand government office are putting the responsibility on Vadodara, and the officials of Vadodara are putting the responsibility on Anand. We are tired of facing all the hassles. The officials replied that the army was also requested to remove the truck by helicopter, but there is no possibility of the truck being removed right now.”

The truck owner further told Bhaskar, “I have a loan on the truck and I have to pay an instalment of Rs 1 lakh every month. If the truck runs, I will be able to pay the instalment. The administration had given me an assurance for removing the truck, but even after so many days, I have not been able to get the truck.”

The title of the Divya Bhaskar report reads- ‘First the truck was hanging, now the officials are ‘hanging’ it: Even after 10 days of the accident, the truck is still on the Gambhira bridge, the driver is wandering to unload the truck, saying – there is an instalment of lakhs per month.’

A Gujarati News’ TV channel, GSTV wrote, ‘The government has raised its hands’, the situation of the truck owner is difficult, and no one is listening to him. It has also been claimed in this report that the truck owner has been doing the rounds of the government offices of Anand-Vadodara for ten days, but he did not get any response. “We have to pay the instalments for the truck. The bank is saying that we have to pay the instalments, while the insurance company is saying that the truck is safe, no insurance will be given,” said the truck owner as quoted by GSTV.

Anand District Collector spoke to OpIndia

When OpIndia contacted Anand District Collector Praveen Chaudhary regarding the entire matter, a different version came to light. He said that there is no dispute between the two districts, and neither is the delay due to the administration blaming each other. The reality is that the truck could not be removed due to some technical reasons that emerged during the rescue operation that lasted for several days. However, the Anand District Collectorate is providing all possible help to the truck owner.

Divulging the details about the entire incident, the Anand District Collector said, “After the bridge accident, it was impossible to take heavy machinery like cranes on the bridge due to technical reasons. The truck will need to be lifted from the front, which was damaged, using a crane. But the Road and Building Department believed that using a crane in such a situation is dangerous.” He said that the rescue operation has been going on continuously, and machines were deployed till yesterday. Now that the rescue operation is almost complete, a team from the mechanical wing of the Road and Building Construction Department is working on it in collaboration with a private company and experts from High Speed Railway Corporation Limited.

“Whether the truck should be pulled back or lifted by providing some support from below is being contemplated. It also has to be seen that there is no danger to any human life in this,” the District Collector said.

The truck was not removed, as a rescue operation was going on

The reason for the delay in removing the truck is that the rescue operation went on for several days after the accident. A tanker was not found, so a sonar machine was brought from Mumbai to search and locate it underwater. When the NDRF started the rescue operation after the incident, the district administration was requested to keep the stranded truck tied so that it would not pose any danger to the rescue efforts going on under the bridge, as the rescue operation was a priority at that time.

After discussing with the NDRF team, the district administration tied the truck to a crane from the back to ensure that the rescue operation went on unaffected. When the Army was consulted, it said that pushing or pulling the truck would require the involvement of people and would put their lives in danger. At present, technical teams of the Road and Building Department are working on the strategy to remove the truck ,and it will be disposed of soon. Teams from both the district administrations are also assisting in the operation.

The collector also clarified the issue of insurance and EMI

The Anand District Collector said that the truck owner visited his office and met him and the additional district magistrate, who explained everything to him. The owner agreed for the truck to be destroyed, but it has to be done in such a way that does not put any life in danger. The plan to do this is being worked out.

As far as insurance is concerned, the District Collector said that he met the insurance company. The company said that if the government gave a written certificate of the incident, they would approve the insurance claim. The collector’s office has also given assurance in this regard, and the written process will be completed with the company.

Regarding EMI, the collector said that although this is a matter between the bank and the truck owner, the administration cannot directly interfere in it, yet he wrote a letter to the bank and requested it to postpone the instalment for two to three months on humanitarian grounds. Also, a representation will be sent to the State Level Bankers Committee, so that the truck owner can get relief on EMI.

The District Collector made it clear that this is not an Anand-Vadodara issue. The area where this incident happened and the truck got stuck is entirely in Vadodara, but since the Vadodara administration was continuously engaged in the rescue operation, the Anand district administration stepped in and provided all possible assistance.",part gambhira bridge connecting saurashtra region central gujarat collapsed morning 9th july 2025 truck got stuck bridge still hanging fifteen day incident medium report based interview truck driver owner claimed official two district anand vadodara denying accountability causing unnecessary hardship truck driver owner running pillar post get truck removed pending emis adding worry truck driver even able claim insurance truck hanging broken gambhira bridge image via x theskindoctor13 report divya bhaskar quoted truck owner ramashankar pal saying ” official anand government office putting responsibility vadodara official vadodara putting responsibility anand tired facing hassle official replied army also requested remove truck helicopter possibility truck removed right ” truck owner told bhaskar “i loan truck pay instalment r 1 lakh every month truck run able pay instalment administration given assurance removing truck even many day able get truck ” title divya bhaskar report read ‘first truck hanging official ‘hanging’ even 10 day accident truck still gambhira bridge driver wandering unload truck saying – instalment lakh per month ’ gujarati news’ tv channel gstv wrote ‘the government raised hands’ situation truck owner difficult one listening also claimed report truck owner round government office anand vadodara ten day get response “we pay instalment truck bank saying pay instalment insurance company saying truck safe insurance given ” said truck owner quoted gstv anand district collector spoke opindia opindia contacted anand district collector praveen chaudhary regarding entire matter different version came light said dispute two district neither delay due administration blaming reality truck could removed due technical reason emerged rescue operation lasted several day however anand district collectorate providing possible help truck owner divulging detail entire incident anand district collector said “after bridge accident impossible take heavy machinery like crane bridge due technical reason truck need lifted front damaged using crane road building department believed using crane situation dangerous ” said rescue operation going continuously machine deployed till yesterday rescue operation almost complete team mechanical wing road building construction department working collaboration private company expert high speed railway corporation limited “whether truck pulled back lifted providing support contemplated also seen danger human life ” district collector said truck removed rescue operation going reason delay removing truck rescue operation went several day accident tanker found sonar machine brought mumbai search locate underwater ndrf started rescue operation incident district administration requested keep stranded truck tied would pose danger rescue effort going bridge rescue operation priority time discussing ndrf team district administration tied truck crane back ensure rescue operation went unaffected army consulted said pushing pulling truck would require involvement people would put life danger present technical team road building department working strategy remove truck disposed soon team district administration also assisting operation collector also clarified issue insurance emi anand district collector said truck owner visited office met additional district magistrate explained everything owner agreed truck destroyed done way put life danger plan worked far insurance concerned district collector said met insurance company company said government gave written certificate incident would approve insurance claim collector’s office also given assurance regard written process completed company regarding emi collector said although matter bank truck owner administration cannot directly interfere yet wrote letter bank requested postpone instalment two three month humanitarian ground also representation sent state level banker committee truck owner get relief emi district collector made clear anand vadodara issue area incident happened truck got stuck entirely vadodara since vadodara administration continuously engaged rescue operation anand district administration stepped provided possible assistance
OpIndia,20/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/pib-fake-news-samosa-jalebi-health-warning-cigarettes-media-news/,Fake claim: PIB calls out false media reports that union health ministry is set to issue health warning for samosa and jalebi like they...,"Many Indian media outlets, including Times of India and NDTV, recently published a news story alleging that popular Indian snacks and sweets such as samosa, jalebi and laddoo will be served alongside a health warning akin to those on cigarette packets. Furthermore, the new development was attributed to the Union Ministry of Health that it has been done in order to tackle health issues.

On 15th July, PIB fact-check, however, refuted the claims as false. It emphasized that the ministry’s advisory does not include any warning labels on food items sold by vendors and “has not been selective towards Indian snacks.”

Additionally, it clarified that the general recommendation is not unique to any one food product but rather serves as a “behavioural nudge” to alert consumers to “hidden fats and excess sugar in all food products.”

✅The general advisory is a behavioural nudge to make people aware of hidden fats and excess sugar in all food products, and not specifically to any particular food product.



The advisory is for healthier options and initiatives at workplaces and urges people to make healthier… pic.twitter.com/gD3f2XOeTF — PIB Fact Check (@PIBFactCheck) July 15, 2025

The agency added that the suggestion encourages “people to make healthier” decisions to reduce unnecessary sugar and oil in favour of a healthy diet and way of life as well as supports healthier workplace options and activities. “It does not target India’s rich street food culture,” it further pointed out.

What is in the letter

The ministry’s official letter identified “sharp rise in obesity in both children and adults” as a significant concern. It informed, “As per NFHS-5 (2019-21), over one in five adults in urban areas are overweight or obese. Prevalence of childhood obesity is impacted by poor dietary habits and reduced physical activity.”

It added, “As per The Lancet GBD 2021 obesity forecasting study, published in 2025, the number of overweight and obese adults in India is projected to rise from 18 crores in 2021 to 44.9 crores by 2050, making it the country with the second-highest global burden.” It stated that obesity dramatically increases the risk of non-communicable diseases like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease and several types of cancer.

The ministry pointed out, “It also affects mental health, mobility, and quality of life, and imposes a heavy economic burden through increased healthcare costs and productivity losses. Early prevention and health promotion are critical to reversing these trends.”

The letter outlined that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made a strong case for changing people’s lifestyles in order to fight obesity. “At the Opening Ceremony of the 38th National Games in Dehradun on 28th January 2025, Hon’ble Prime Minister invoked the Fit India Campaign and urged citizens to adopt active, healthy lifestyles as part of the broader vision of a Swasth Bharat. In his Mann Ki Baat, he called for a 10% reduction in oil consumption,” the official communiqué read.

It then conveyed, “In response to this national appeal, and as part of the ministry’s flagship initiatives under the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases (NP-NCD), it is imperative to promote sustainable behavioural changes in our workplaces. These include reducing excessive consumption of oil and sugar, both of which are key contributors to rising rates of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and other lifestyle-related disorders.”

According to the letter, it is advocating that Sugar and Oil Boards be displayed as an effort to encourage better eating practices in multiple settings. They will function as visual behavioural cues in public spaces like offices and schools, revealing important details including hidden sugars and fats in common food items.

Hence, a direction to all “departments/offices/autonomous bodies and other public institutions/organizations” under the ministry was sought.

Claims linking sudden deaths to COVID vaccine

Several claims linking sudden deaths caused by heart attack to the COVID-19 vaccine have been spreading across social media for years. However, the central government debunked all these claims earlier this month, on the grounds of two extensive studies conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research(ICMR) and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences. The studies found that there was no direct link between sudden deaths by heart attack and the COVID-19 vaccines.

Besides, studies by the ICMR and National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) affirmed that COVID-19 vaccines in India are safe and effective, with extremely rare instances of serious side effects. Sudden deaths due to heart attacks can be linked to a wide range of factors, including genetics, lifestyle, pre-existing conditions, and post-COVID complications.

To understand the causes of sudden, unexplained deaths, especially in young adults between the ages of 18 and 45 years, the ICMR and the NCDC conducted a study across 47 tertiary care hospitals in 19 states and UTs. Another study conducted by AIIMS with ICMR funding also examined cases of sudden cardiac deaths and found genetic mutations, pre-existing conditions, and lifestyle as the primary causes of these deaths and no correlation with Covid-19 vaccination.",medium portal print recently seen spreading fake news purported study conducted central government analyse pattern “to assess pattern sudden deaths” india covid 19 pandemic print published news article july 8 2025 claimed health research department dhr union ministry health collaborating inclen international clinical epidemiology network international new delhi based health research organisation conduct national community level study examine rise death among people 45 year age screenshot news article published print quoting inclen international executive director proposed lead analyst n k arora print claimed “the new nationwide assessment aim document sudden death community level across states” added “this larger study analyse trend death attempt determine risk factor mortalities” however print news article fact checked pib termed claim made fake news report theprintindia claimed centre commissioned nationwide study assess pattern sudden death india pibfactcheck ❌ claim fake ✅ nationwide survey commissioned centre department health… pic twitter com gpsrc1hz1c — pib fact check pibfactcheck july 9 2025 pib posted x “in news report theprintindia claimed centre commissioned nationwide study assess pattern sudden death india nationwide survey commissioned centre depthealthres dhr ” claim linking sudden death covid vaccine several claim linking sudden death caused heart attack covid 19 vaccine spreading across social medium year however central government debunked claim earlier month ground two extensive study conducted indian council medical research icmr india institute medical science study found direct link sudden death heart attack covid 19 vaccine besides study icmr national centre disease control ncdc affirmed covid 19 vaccine india safe effective extremely rare instance serious side effect sudden death due heart attack linked wide range factor including genetics lifestyle pre existing condition post covid complication understand cause sudden unexplained death especially young adult age 18 45 year icmr ncdc conducted study across 47 tertiary care hospital 19 state ut another study conducted aiims icmr funding also examined case sudden cardiac death found genetic mutation pre existing condition lifestyle primary cause death correlation covid 19 vaccination

The book titled “Exploring Society: India and Beyond” introduces students to some important events and episodes in Indian history, including the Delhi Sultanate, the Mughal rule, the Maratha empire and the colonial period. The book has recently become the cause of a huge liberal meltdown.

The book has a chapter titled “Reshaping India’s Political Map”, which covers Indian history between the 13th and the 17th century, including the rise and fall of the Delhi Sultanate and the resistance to it, the Vijayanagar Empire, the Mughal Empire, and the resistance faced by them, and the rise of the Sikhs.

At the beginning of the book comes is a note for students, which gives them a contextual understanding of the inclusion of some dark historical episodes like the Islamic fundamentalism in the book and the approach to be adopted while studying them. “History sometimes seems to be full of wars and destruction… Should we omit them entirely? … The best approach is to face them and analyse them so as to understand what made such developments possible and, hopefully, help avoid their recurrence in future. It is important to study those darker developments dispassionately, without blaming anyone living today for them… The past continues to live with us and shapes the present.”

To be introduced in schools from the 2025-26 academic year, the book attempts to provide a complete picture of historical events or periods included in it by retaining their negative as well as positive aspects. While the book mentions how Mughal rulers Jahangir and Shah Jahan patronised art and architecture, it also highlights the brutalities of Babur, who massacred the entire populations of cities. It describes Aurangzeb as a military ruler who banned un-Islamic practices and reimposed taxes on non-Muslims and defines the rule of Mughal ruler Akbar, the left-liberal coterie’s poster boy of the Mughal period, as a “blend of brutality and tolerance”.

But the left liberals, who are habitual of using history as a tool to further their agenda, have a problem with it. They have a problem because the facade built by leftist historians who downplayed and whitewashed the brutalities of Islamic invaders and justified their atrocities against Hindus is crumbling. For a long time, they pushed a false narrative by portraying Mughal King Akbar as the epitome of religious tolerance. They eulogised him for abolishing the Jizya tax, a religious tax levied by Muslim rulers on Hindus and other non-Muslims for merely existing in an Islamic regime, but cleverly omitted to mention how he waged Jihad against Hindus during the seige of Chittorgarh and ordered the massacre of 30,000 Hindus populace.

The seige of Chittoragarh

By 1567, Mughal ruler Akbar had managed to get most parts of northern India under his control. Now, he was eyeing the Kingdom of Mewar, which was being ruled by the Suryavanshi Sisodia Rajput dynasty at that time, under Rana Udai Singh II. The Mewar kingdom stood as a symbol of resistance against the Mughal Empire, which had subdued most of the surrounding kingdoms. Akbar decided to launch a military expedition to besiege the Mewar capital at Chittorgarh and termed it as ‘Jihad’ against the infidels (Hindus).

Chittorgarh, situated in present-day Rajasthan, was a formidable fort spanning across 700 acres, situated atop 180 a high hill in the heart of the Mewar Kingdom. The fortress had survived the sieges by Aluddin Khilji (1303) and Bahadur Shah of Gujarat (1535).

Refusing to bow down before the Mughal emperor, Rana Udai Singh II geared up to defend his kingdom. In October 1567, Akbar marched from Agra with his army of 40,000 men equipped with cannons, muskets and siege equipment, aiming to bring the Mewar Kingdom to its knees. Inside the Chittorgarh fort was an army of 8000 Rajput warriors prepared to defend their pride. On the advice of his counsels, Rana Udai Singh II moved to his principality in the Aravali hills and left the Rajput army under the command of Jaimal Rathore.

The Mughal army strategically set up their camp at the base of the Chittorgarh hill to cut off supplies to the fort. The siege began, and both armies soon engaged in a full-fledged battle with arrows, musket shots and cannon shots flying across the sky. The Mughal army was struggling to penetrate the 30-feet-thick walls of the Chittorgarh fort. The Mughal soldiers made several strategies to breach the mighty walls of the Chittorgarh fort. They tried to stealthily march towards the base of the fort through covered trenches and dig burrows under the foundation of the fort and pack gunpowder in them to blow up the fort’s base. However, the Rajput armies were watching them. They dug counter-mines and resisted the Mughal armies, which suffered heavy losses.

The battle went on for months, till the fateful day when the Rajput commander Jaimal Rathore fell. There are varied accounts of the cause of Jaimal Rathore’s death. Some accounts say that he died from a musket shot fired by Akbar on February 22, 1568. Other accounts mention that Rathore was killed by Mughal marksmen. Jaimal Rathore’s death was a turning point in the battle, as the Rajput armies were demoralised and the Mughal armies were able to breach the fort. As soon as the fort was breached by the Mughal armies, the Rajput women inside the fort performed jauhar to protect their honour from the enemy. The remaining Rajput soldiers put up a final resistance before the Mughal armies and laid down their lives, before the fort was finally captured on February 23-24, 1568.

Some Mughal sources say that the Rajput armies of about 8000-10,000 men were entirely killed. Mughal king Akbar, who was frustrated and enraged by the stiff resistance put up by the Rajput armies, proclaimed the siege of Chittorgarh and the victory of Islam over infidels and ordered the massacre of the entire civilian population of around 30,000 people. The men were killed, and several women and children were enslaved.

But, according to left-liberals, Mughal King Akbar was a liberal and tolerant ruler, who abolished the Jizya tax, and not a cruel, intolerant tyrant who ordered the slaughter of thousands of innocent, unarmed Hindu civilians of the Chittorgarh fort, who posed no harm to him. This special ability to see one truth by ignoring the other truth is peculiar to the left-liberals. The only acceptable truth to them is their version of truth, no matter how incomplete, selective or even untrue it is.

This unique quality of theirs begs the question, Jo cheez jaisi hai usey vaisa usey vaisa he pesh kyo na kiya jaye, taat ko resham kyo kaha jaye?

It has been revealed that humans lived in that are around 4,000 years ago. Scientists who were searching for additional information about the captivating location in the Raichur district made the discovery. A collaborative team of 20 researches from India, Canada and the United States worked together to learn more about the area’s past.

Researchers have been excavating around Mallikarjun Hill, close to the Mallikarjuna Temple and the town’s Anjaneya Swamy temple. They have come across a variety of artefacts and other tools that date back four millennia which suggests that the area was once a vibrant settlement.

Professor Dr Andrew M. Bauer of Stanford University in the United States, Dr. Peter G. Johansen of McGill University in Canada and Hemanth Kadambi of Shiv Nadar University in Delhi-NCR (National Capital Region) alongside their team of over 20 researchers have been seeking evidence of human habitation and civilisation in Maski for the past three months.

They approached Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) for approval and afterward the crew began exploring Maski. The scientists identified 271 places of interest in the area and began their work. They unearthed evidence that the area surrounding the temple and Mallikarjun Hill was occupied by people from the 11th to the 14th century BCE.

They located an array of antiquities, including cooking tools like earthen pots and pans. Kadambi declared, “We have found evidence that indicates that there was a human settlement in Maski around 4,000 years ago.”

Maski inscription

Notably, British gold mine engineer C. Beadon found the Maski inscription in 1915. The region made its place on the archaeological map when the inscription, which dates to the time of the Mauryan emperor Ashoka, came to light. It was etched onto a rock surface within a cave.

One of the earliest inscriptions from the Mauryan era, it prominently displays the emperor’s name and his title as “Devanampriya” (Beloved of the Gods). A long-standing disagreement about whether the legendary ruler was actually referred to by the title or not was resolved when the same was mentioned alongside his name. It was written in Brahmi script and in the Prakrit language, highlighting his adherence to non-violence.",remarkable archaeological finding drawn attention karnataka’s maski town revealed human lived around 4 000 year ago scientist searching additional information captivating location raichur district made discovery collaborative team 20 research india canada united state worked together learn area’s past researcher excavating around mallikarjun hill close mallikarjuna temple town’s anjaneya swamy temple come across variety artefact tool date back four millennium suggests area vibrant settlement professor dr andrew bauer stanford university united state dr peter g johansen mcgill university canada hemanth kadambi shiv nadar university delhi ncr national capital region alongside team 20 researcher seeking evidence human habitation civilisation maski past three month approached archaeological survey india asi approval afterward crew began exploring maski scientist identified 271 place interest area began work unearthed evidence area surrounding temple mallikarjun hill occupied people 11th 14th century bce located array antiquity including cooking tool like earthen pot pan kadambi declared “we found evidence indicates human settlement maski around 4 000 year ago ” maski inscription notably british gold mine engineer c beadon found maski inscription 1915 region made place archaeological map inscription date time mauryan emperor ashoka came light etched onto rock surface within cave one earliest inscription mauryan era prominently display emperor’s name title “devanampriya” beloved god long standing disagreement whether legendary ruler actually referred title resolved mentioned alongside name written brahmi script prakrit language highlighting adherence non violence

While the attack itself was disturbing, what sparked further indignation was how Irish mainstream media chose to report the incident.

Instead of unequivocally condemning the brutality, reports used language that cast doubt on the nature of the crime, referring to it as an “alleged assault” despite the visible and horrific injuries sustained by the victim. This minimisation of violence, which bore all the hallmarks of a racially motivated hate crime, was called out in strong terms by the Indian Ambassador to Ireland, Akhilesh Mishra.

Ambassador Akhilesh Mishra exposes media bias over assault against an Indian origin man

Ambassador Mishra’s comments came with images of news reports that chose to cast doubt over the victim’s trauma, a strategy not unfamiliar to those tracking media narratives targeting Hindus globally. In doing so, Mishra highlighted an uncomfortable truth: that certain Western media institutions would rather gaslight Indian victims than confront the racial or ideological motivations behind such hate crimes.

The incident: A false accusation, brutal assault, and media whitewashing

The Indian man, who had arrived in Ireland just three weeks earlier, was assaulted and partially stripped in public in Tallaght on Saturday evening, July 19. According to The Irish Times, a mob confronted the man and falsely accused him of acting inappropriately around children, claims that were later disseminated online as part of a digital witch-hunt.

Irish police (Gardaí) have since confirmed that no evidence exists to support the accusations, yet the man was violently attacked, left bleeding, and taken to Tallaght University Hospital with serious injuries. Gardaí are now investigating the case as a possible hate crime, and there is speculation that the attack was racially motivated.

Local councillor Baby Pereppadan (Fine Gael) visited the victim and said he remains in shock and is not taking visitors. “Small incidents like these are happening frequently in Tallaght,” he warned, urging stronger police deployment in the area.

Sinn Féin TD Seán Crowe condemned the mob action as “vile and utterly unacceptable.” “Anyone who thinks this sort of mindless, racist violence makes their community safer is lying and fooling no one. This is not the first such attack in our area but it has to be the last,” he said.

A pattern of dehumanisation: Global racism targeting Hindus

While people of colour, especially Africans and South-East Asians, have long faced discrimination in the West, the treatment meted out to Indians, and Hindus in particular, reveals a unique and consistent pattern of prejudice. Hindus are not just exoticised or mocked; they are systematically demonised, dehumanised, and often blamed for the crimes of their persecutors.

Nowhere is this more apparent than in the disturbing trends on social media platforms where Hindu identity, symbols, and customs are routinely mocked with impunity.

From derogatory “cow piss” jibes to offensive caricatures of Hindu deities, the Hinduphobia is not just a cultural issue; it is a civilisational struggle where polytheistic traditions and Sanatan values are targeted by both far-left ideologues and right-wing supremacists, particularly in the West.

One need only look at the case of Stew Peters, a self-styled “America First” commentator who in 2024 described Hindus as “dot-headed cockroaches,” falsely alleging that Indians smear cow dung on their faces. Or Laura Loomer, who launched a xenophobic tirade against Indian-American Sriram Krishnan following his appointment to a senior AI policy position at the White House, calling Indians “third-world invaders.”

The vitriol extended far beyond individuals. Hindu deities like Maa Kali and Lord Ganesha were called “supervillains,” “demonic,” and “unfit for a first-world Christian country.” These sentiments are not just isolated outbursts but part of a coordinated campaign to otherise and vilify the Hindu community, especially those living proudly and unapologetically in the diaspora.

And this bigotry is undergirded by latent racism against Indians, particularly Hindus, and it rises to the surface every now and then, in both physical and psychological form —from attacking them literally as witnessed in Dublin to more sophisticated forms of assault — Hindumisic conferences organised in western universities that serve to legitimise such racism and give way to its more dangerous siblings, bigotry and dehumanisation.

The “Dismantling Global Hindutva” Conference: Institutionalised hatred of Hindus

Perhaps the most blatant example of institutionalised Hinduphobia came in the form of the “Dismantling Global Hindutva” conference held in September 2021. Sponsored by over 60 academic departments from 45+ universities, primarily in the United States, the three-day event brought together some of the most vocal and virulent anti-Hindu activists in academia and media.

The speakers list read like a who’s who of Hindumisia, including Audrey Truschke, Anand Patwardhan, Nandini Sundar, and Neha Dixit, individuals known for drawing false equivalences between Hindutva and Nazism. Ironically, the event’s poster depicted an inverted hammer violently uprooting a saffron-clad RSS Swayamsevak, a visual metaphor for the organised dismantling of Hindu civilisational identity.

The hammer, disguised as a pencil, was meant to portray “academic critique,” but its Nazi-esque symbolism mirrored the Röhm Putsch imagery of Nazi propaganda, where ‘eliminating violent elements’ was used to justify political murders. In this case, the target wasn’t a rogue militia. It was a symbolic attack on Hindus who dare to be assertive about their culture and beliefs.

The points of discussion during the conference followed a classic Goebbelsian propaganda template: select a few emotive triggers, repeat them endlessly, and cast your enemies as the threat to civilisation. It’s a strategy that paves the way for dehumanisation and, eventually, justifies violence.

The RSS or other Hindu organisations targeted aren’t paramilitary thugs. They are groups that aid flood victims, rescue women from trafficking, or assist during pandemics, tasks most self-proclaimed ‘liberal saviours’ wouldn’t touch. So why label them “militant”?

Because self-defence, cultural reclamation, and Hindu unity threaten the ideological monopoly of Islamists, Marxists, and global evangelists.

Research reveals a disturbing surge in Hinduphobic slurs and hate speech across social media platforms

A comprehensive 2023 study by the Network Contagion Research Institute (NCRI) lends credence to Mishra’s concerns. The report, ‘Quantitative Methods for Investigating Anti-Hindu Disinformation’, found a sharp rise in derogatory and genocidal content targeting Hindus across platforms like 4Chan, Telegram, Gab, and Twitter. These include memes and slurs such as “pajeet”, a racial epithet used to mock and dehumanise Hindus, alongside visual propaganda depicting Hindu symbols like tilaks and saffron clothing being subjected to ISIS-style beheadings or Nazi-style executions. The analysis also showed that the usage of such coded hate terms surged dramatically around key geopolitical events involving India, indicating coordinated disinformation efforts.

Perhaps most alarmingly, the NCRI discovered that Iranian state-sponsored troll networks were deeply involved in disseminating Hinduphobic content, often under fake Pakistani identities. These accounts strategically amplified hashtags and tropes accusing Hindus of genocide, inflaming caste divisions, and misrepresenting communal incidents like the 2020 Delhi riots. The trolls pretended to be human rights activists while tagging major news outlets like CNN and MSNBC to internationalise their narrative. This manipulation of digital platforms for geopolitical ends shows that Hinduphobia is not merely social bigotry; it is being weaponised as a tool of hybrid warfare.

The incident in Dublin, therefore, is not just a case of individual victimisation, it is a symptom of a transnational campaign to dehumanise Hindus in both physical and ideological realms. The assault, followed by media whitewashing, echoes the same patterns identified in the NCRI report: digital dehumanisation leading to real-world violence. Mishra’s remarks, then, are not only a defence of one man’s dignity but a broader call to recognise and confront the systemic erasure of Hindu identity under the guise of liberal tolerance.

From Anti-CAA protests to Digital pogroms

The dehumanisation of Hindus gained major momentum during the anti-CAA protests in India. Posters morphed the sacred Om into Nazi swastikas, women wearing bindis were portrayed as oppressors, and slogans like “Hinduon se Azadi” (Freedom from Hindus) echoed across protest sites. The song “Jab sab but tod diye jaayenge, bas Allah ka naam rahega” (“When all idols are broken, only Allah’s name shall remain”) was not fringe. It was mainstream. And it was celebrated.

This same contempt now fuels the global narrative, where being a proud Hindu in the West is considered an act of aggression, and where Indian immigrants are seen not as contributors, but cultural contaminants.

Are Hindus “invading” the West?

Contrary to the far-right and leftist narrative, Hindus aren’t flooding Western countries. As per Pew Research (2024):

Hindus make up only 5% of the global migrant population. Though 94% of Hindus live in India, only 57% of global Hindu migrants are from India. In contrast, Christians form 47% and Muslims 29% of global migrants.

The “Hindu invasion” is a myth, an imaginary construct, a bogeyman to manufacture hate.

From Dublin to Dismantling Hindutva: A global war on Hindus?

The Dublin assault and its casual dismissal by mainstream media is more than just a reporting failure. It is a symptom of a larger disease — a civilisational bias against Hindus that spans continents, cultures, and ideologies.

From hate crimes on the streets of Ireland and America to academic witch hunts like Dismantling Global Hindutva, Hindus today are not just being targeted physically, but also intellectually, politically, and spiritually.

Ambassador Akhilesh Mishra’s tweet is not just a diplomatic protest; it is a call to wake up. To recognise that being Hindu, wearing saffron, reciting shlokas, or simply existing unapologetically, is enough to be branded a target.

The question is no longer whether Hindus are being demonised. The question is: How long will we pretend that it’s not happening?

How online hatred fuels real-world attacks on Indians and Hindus

The Tallaght assault is a chilling reminder that online hate doesn’t just remain on the internet, it metastasizes into real-world violence.

In this case, false accusations against the Indian victim were first circulated online, accusing him of inappropriate behaviour near children. These baseless claims spread like wildfire on local WhatsApp groups and Facebook pages, ultimately emboldening a mob to hunt him down, strip him, beat him, and leave him bleeding on the street.

This incident mirrors a disturbing trend: social media platforms have become hotbeds for anti-Indian and anti-Hindu bigotry, often driven by coordinated misinformation campaigns and algorithmic

The Druze-majority province of Sweida, long considered a relatively stable enclave in a strife-torn country, has plumbed into chaos after violent clashes erupted between Druze self-defence militias and armed Sunni Bedouin tribes.

The Syrian government’s decision to intervene, ostensibly to restore order, has instead drawn fierce criticism, with eyewitnesses and human rights observers accusing Damascus of using the unrest as a pretext to carry out a brutal crackdown on the Druze community.

As the conflict spirals, disturbing reports have emerged of field executions, looting, and arson carried out by state forces and their allies. The violence has laid bare the fragile nature of Syria’s post-Assad political transition, with interim president Ahmed al-Sharaa, himself a former jihadist commander, struggling to maintain legitimacy among minority groups.

What was once framed as a peacekeeping operation is now seen by many Druze as a calculated campaign of ethnic and sectarian cleansing, pushing the region toward open rebellion and international intervention.

Syrian officials have faced allegations of conducting summary executions of civilians in the Druze-dominated Sweida. Damascus sent troops to the region after Druze fighters and Sunni Bedouin tribes clashed, which killed several people, including women and children. Afterwards, the country’s defence minister Murhaf Abu Qasra declared a ceasefire in the city on 15th July as government forces arrived in the morning.

The “notables and dignitaries” of the city had reached an agreement, he stated and added that government forces would “respond only to the sources of fire and deal with any targeting by outlaw groups.” Nonetheless, altercations were witnessed as did complaints of human right breaches by security personnel.

The locals accused government troops and their allies of tearing through Druze neighbourhoods. They informed AFP that the development had little impact on the ground. The interior ministry also admitted that the conflicts persisted into the evening.

On the same day, the United Kingdom-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights unveiled that 21 members of the minority group had been killed in and around the region by Syrian government forces and their aides.

According to the war monitor, the violence which broke out since early 13th July already claimed the lives of at least 248 people, comprising 92 Druze and 28 of them were civilians. The observatory previously highlighted that forces from the “defence and interior ministries carried out field executions of 12 (19 per some reports) civilians after storming the Radwan family guest house in the city of Sweida.”

It further mentioned that armed groups associated with the government were also accountable for the shooting of three siblings in the presence of their mother in Sweida province. Rayan Maarouf, the editor-in-chief of the Suwayda 24 news website revealed that security forces had been involved in “savage practices.”

He pointed out that there have been instances of brutal murders of civilians and expressed, “dozens of them, yet we do not possess accurate figures.” Suwayda 24 further informed that more than 200 people had been injured. Social media posts featured videos of armed combatants abusing Druze prisoners and shaving their beards.

The agency disclosed that the defence ministry employees took part in “systematic acts of vandalism targeting civilian homes and property” and “stealing the contents of homes, smashing doors and windows, and then setting fire to some of them” among other acts of crimes. Men in military outfits were observed robbing and burning houses as well as liquor stores.

The government troops entered the city with Bedouin fighters and accompanied them in attacking the Druze, according to the observatory, Druze leaders and witnesses. Gunfire and dead bodies laying on empty streets were reported by an AFP correspondent who landed in Sweida soon after the forces.

“Catastrophic” is how one Suweida local described the situation, adding that indiscriminate firing has caused residents to “flee towards the countryside” in spite of a curfew imposed by Syrian authorities, reported BBC Arabic.

Concern among the Druze increased when Islamist groups connected with the Syrian government joined the conflict leading a prominent member of the community to demand “international protection.” The majority of Druze religious leader also announced that they were in favour of the government’s deployment following the Bedouin violence.

However, they later called for armed resistance as the unrest escalated and voiced, “We are being subject to a total war of extermination,” and urged the Druze population “to confront this barbaric campaign with all means available.”

The authorities have been ordered to “take immediate legal action against anyone proven to have committed a transgression or abuse, regardless of their rank or position,” according to a statement released by former Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) commander and current interim president Ahmad al-Sharaa.

Tit-for-tat kidnappings and attacks between local Bedouin tribes and Druze armed forces in the southern province sparked bloodshed two days after a Druze businessman was kidnapped on the highway to Damascus. This marked the first deployment of Syrian government forces to Suweida since the Islamist-led rebels ousted President Bashar al-Assad in December.

Israel enters the conflict

Israel conveyed that after two days of deadly sectarian riots, it had targeted the government forces in the vicinity of Sweida as they moved into the largely Druze city. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu maintained that the government “intended to use (them) against the Druze.” Hence, he ordered strikes on forces and weapons in the area.

Israel with its own Druze population has promised to defend the members of the community who are living in Syria. It views any military deployment south of Damascus as a security hazard and has cautioned the Syrian government against the same. It vowed to continue the assault to protect the group.

On the other hand, the Syrian foreign ministry insisted that the strikes killed several civilians and members of the security forces, but failed to offer any exact numbers. The ministry denounced the Israeli attacks in a statement.

It termed them as “a reprehensible example of ongoing aggression and foreign interference in the internal affairs of sovereign states” and “a blatant violation of the sovereignty of the Syrian Arab Republic.”

Israel, nevertheless, complied with the Trump administration’s request to stop its strikes. The United States even deployed tanks to the troubled area. According to the country’s Syria envoy Tom Barrack, the US is communicating with all parties “to navigate towards calm and integration.”

The U.S. official claimed the Syrian government had informed Israel in advance that it was sending tanks to the Sweida area in southern Syria and stressed this was not an action directed at Israel but an attempt to restore order in internal clashes between Druze militias and a… https://t.co/a7SzPzx9AV — Barak Ravid (@BarakRavid) July 15, 2025

The recent camaraderie between Donald Trump and Ahmed al-Sharaa surprised many, as the former referred to the ex-Islamic terrorist as a “young, attractive and tough guy.” Washington even rescinded the $10 million bounty on his head and removed sanctions placed on Syria.

With the overthrow of Assad regime, the Jewish state has adopted a tough posture towards Syria’s new authorities, arguing it does not want terrorists along its borders. Israeli forces have executed hundreds of airstrikes on Syrian military targets and taken control of a United Nations-patrolled buffer zone on Syrian territory near the Golan Heights border.

Who are the minority Druze community

The majority of the nearly one million members of the Druze Arab sect reside in Syria, Lebanon and Israel. The group which originated in Egypt in the eleventh century, is an offshoot of Ismailism, branch of Shia Islam that forbids marriages and conversions to or from the faith.

The Druze are mostly found in three major provinces in the southern part of Syria, near the Israeli-ruled Golan Heights. They primarily reside in the Sweida province and a few Damascus suburbs, especially in Ashrafiyat Sahnaya and Jaramana to the south.

The Golan Heights, a strategically located plateau that Israel annexed in 1981 after capturing it from Syria during the 1967 Six-Day War is inhabited by around 20,000 Druze. There are about 25,000 Jews also staying in over 30 villages on the territory.

When Israel took over Golan, the majority of the Druze who identify as Syrian, turned down an offer of Israeli citizenship. Israeli residency cards were issued to those who declined although they are not regarded as the country’s citizens.

There is a Druze diaspora outside of the Middle East, especially in North America and Australia. Their population was expected to be over 700,000 until Syria’s civil conflict broke out in 2011. The Druze have been migrating to southern Syria since the 16th century, to what is now known as Jabal al-Druze or Druze Mountain in Sweida province, according to historian Sami Makarem’s book “The Druze Faith.”

During the ten-year civil war, the Druze who form the majority in the Suwayda region in southern Syria were pushed between the forces of the previous Assad administration and extremist organisations. Druze militias had retained a strong hold on Suweida, resisting appeals to join the security forces.

As the nation then took pride in its secular and Arab nationalist system, religious freedom was ensured under the strict control of the Assad family. Ahmed al-Sharaa also promised to safeguard them, however, his government is regarded with suspicion by them and other minorities.

The new 23-member Syrian cabinet unveiled in late March only featured one Druze member, Minister of Agriculture Amjad Badr, despite the transitional government’s commitment to incorporate minorities, including the Druze.

Earlier, many Druze citizens were slain including extrajudicially, as a result of sectarian warfare against their militias by Syrian transitional government armed forces and associated outfits that started on 28th April. Likewise, Christian and Alawite minority communities faced severe persecution few months after the new administration took charge.

Ahmed al-Sharaa’s ties to terrorism

The war name of Ahmed al-Sharaa was Abu Mohammad al-Jawlani. The United States classified him as a terrorist and the United Nations (UN) proscribed him. Over the past 20 years, he held significant positions in global terrorist organisations like Al Qaeda and ISIS. He was designated a global terrorist in 2013.

He collaborated closely with ISIS chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and Al Qaeda’s Aiman al-Zawahiri. He was instructed by the former to start a local outfit to provide a front for Al Qaeda Iraq and Syria during the 2011 uprising against the Assad regime. The Al-Nusrah Front also called Jabhat al-Nusrah or Jabhat Fatah al-Sham was founded by him in 2012.

This UN-designated terrorist group was officially acknowledged as the Syrian branch of Al Qaeda. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham or HTS became the new name for the Jabhat Fatah al-Sham in 2017. Its main objectives were to overthrow the Assad government and establish an Islamic Caliphate.

The group spearheaded a swift and widespread assault and seized areas which were under the Assad government. Afterward, retaliatory killings became rampant in Syria following Ahmed al-Sharaa’s takeover as his Sunni hardliner supporters and radicals targeted people from minority communities.

Therefore, while some Druze opposed Bashar al-Assad’s dictatorial government, they are also wary of Ahmed al-Sharaa, an Islamist leader with a history of perpetrating Islamic jihad. Reservations about some of their leaders being left out of his national discussion processes have been presented by them.",began localised tribal scuffle southern syria snowballed full blown

OpIndia,20/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/keeladi-excavation-controversy-over-the-asi-report-by-amarnath-ramakrishna-why-is-the-tn-govt-at-loggerheads-with-asi-and-centre-over-it/,Keeladi excavation and controversy over the ASI report by Amarnath Ramakrishna: Why is the TN govt at loggerheads with ASI and Centre over it,"The excavation at Keeladi, located in Tamil Nadu, unveiled proof of an early urbanized society in South India, which captivated the interest of the whole nation. The first stages of the initiative, started in 2014, were headed by archaeologist K Amarnath Ramakrishna.

However, a significant political dispute between the Tamil Nadu government and the centre has unfolded by his repeated transfers and the Archaeological Survey of India’s (ASI) reservations about his excavation report.

K Amarnath is now appointed as the Director of the National Mission on Monuments and Antiquity (NMMA) in Greater Noida. He was employed as the Director of the National Mission on Monuments and Antiquity in New Delhi prior to the transfer, which occurred six months after his last assignment. He had previously spent three months in the position of Director for Excavation and Exploration.

K Amarnath was ordered to modify his report by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), however, he denied to comply, leading to a fierce war of words between the central and state governments.

How it all began: The Keeladi findings and its significance

Keeladi also known as Keezhadi is on the Vaigai river basin, situated in the Sivaganga district, approximately 12 kilometers southeast of Madurai. Excavations were started more than ten years ago at the Pallichanthai Tidal in Keeladi which was once a 100-acre coconut grove by Amarnath Ramakrishna, the ASI’s superintending archaeologist at the time. Keeladi stood out among the over 100 locations he had selected for excavation along the Vaigai River.

Over 7,500 ancient artefacts, such as wells, drainage systems and wall structures were discovered there, pointing to a thriving and advanced urban society. These materials were disclosed to be more than 2,160 years old, dating to the second century BCE (Before Common Era) which coincides with Tamil history’s Sangam period, according to carbon dating.

The ASI conducted the first three of the eight rounds of excavations. After the Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology (TNSDA) assumed responsibility for the project, the artefacts accumulated to over 18,000, which included pottery, inscribed potsherds, gold ornaments, copper articles, semi-precious stones, shell and ivory bangles, glass beads, spindle whorls, terracotta seals, and weaving tools.

The location produced more than 120 potsherds with Tamil Brahmi inscriptions. The discovery alongside thousand inscribed potsherds from other areas demonstrated the script’s continued existence in the region. Copper needles, clay seals, spinning whorls, yarn hanging stones, terracotta spheres, and earthen containers for liquids alluded to different stages of the weaving industry.

They also indicated that Keeladi was a strong, well-planned and sophisticated urban community with traces of businesses like beadmaking, dyeing and pottery. The artistic, culturally diverse and affluent lifestyle of the Keeladi people is reflected in gold decorations, copper objects, semi-precious stones, shell bangles, ivory bangles and ivory combs.

Beads made of carnelian and agate reflected importation through business networks. Furthermore, their recreational interests had been disclosed through the uncovering of terracotta and ivory dice, gamesmen and signs of hopscotch which also revealed the presence of an elite society. It was also unearthed that the area’s fertility and cow husbandry were key factors in its development, opening the door for the locals to engage in sea trading and produce an abundance of rice.

The results showcased a far older and more developed civilisation than previously believed, pushing the Sangam Age in Tamil Nadu back to about 800 BCE, as per reports. The Sangam Age, also known as the Tamil Sangam period, is a significant period in the history of South India. It was named for the Sangam, an assembly of Tamil poets and academics, saw a flourishing of literature and culture in southern India. It was generally accepted to have occurred between approximately 300 BCE and 300 CE (Common Era).

The Keeladi objects displayed certain symbols that were similar to those of the Indus Valley Civilization. However, there is cultural separation of roughly 1,000 years and scholars anticipated that more research would shed light on this relationship.

Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology asserted that Keeladi possessed all the hallmarks of an urban civilisation, including brick buildings, upscale goods and evidence of both domestic and international trade. It presented itself as a highly developed and hard-working civilisation and provided proof of Tamil Nadu’s urban life and settlements throughout the Early Historic Period. Additionally, Keeladi only strengthened Sangam Literature’s legitimacy.

Strong structures orientated in cardinal directions unveiled systematic urban planning and pot fragments with Tamil Brahmi inscriptions confirmed a literate culture. The sun and moon graffiti revealed the people’s astronomical awareness.

Keeladi was an urban town from the Sangam era and the cultural deposits discovered during the fourth phase of excavations could be easily dated to a time between the sixth and first centuries BCE, according to a 2019 report from the Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology. One of the six samples sent to the United States for carbon testing was dated 580 BCE. It was taken at a depth of 353 centimetres.

Notably, according to the findings presented in the report, the Keeladi artefacts date back approximately 300 years earlier than the previously believed 3rd century BCE.

Ramakrishna’s discovery and subsequent transfer

Keeladi was found by Amarnath Ramakrishna, who supervised the first two seasons of excavations from 2014 to 2016 and handed over a 982-page report to ASI Director General V. Vidyavathi. The report’s twelve chapters provided an explanation of the excavation’s goals and historical context.

The 23 samples that were dated using Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) at the Beta Analytical Lab in Florida of the United States were covered in a different chapter. It also incorporated research on floral and faunal remains from the site to arrive at the period, as well as discoveries from other universities, as per reports.

The first two phases of excavation at Keeladi yielded about 5,800 artefacts after which Ramakrishna was transferred to Assam. The action was reportedly viewed as a setback to the effort. The centre was accused by critics of purposefully sabotaging the excavations because it had committed to release funds and support for additional digging, but postponed both.

Meanwhile, the excavations had already progressed into their third phase under archaeologist PS Sriraman. Interestingly, Sriraman announced that there was no continuity in the brick constructions that had been found earlier, after 400 square meters of excavation. As a result, claims emerged from Tamil Nadu that the centre was actively ‘downplaying’ Keeladi’s prominence, aided by the usual political narratives of anti-North India sentiments that is seen in Tamil political discourse.

TN Govt took up excavation project after ASI stopped, found 13,000 more items

The ASI halted excavations at the site, arguing that the third phase produced no significant outcomes. However, the work was taken over by the Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology in 2017 and thousands of artefacts have since been unearthed. The ninth phase of the excavations was launched by Chief Minister MK Stalin in April 2023 and ended in September of the same year.

The Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology has been able to uncover more than 13,000 items and acquire radiocarbon dates from 580 BCE to 200 CE. The excavations, entered their tenth phase by 2024-2025 and already produced hundreds of antiques.

Furthermore, a 30-foot-long new structure has recently been found at the third trench of the Keeladi excavation after ASI ruled out the possibility of any noteworthy discovery at the site. The bricks used in this new structure are identical in design and make to those used in other parts.

“The bricks used in this new structure are identical in design and make to those used in other parts of Keeladi, strengthening the authenticity of the findings. Earlier studies by Amarnath Ramakrishna’s team had already suggested the area might have housed industrial zones,” V Marappan, Professor of History at Presidency College, outlined while talking to The Federal.

He added, “These new findings raise questions about whether other sections of the site remain unexcavated underground.” The new structure, east-west orientated was discovered 90 centimetres below the surface on the western side. Its length is estimated to be approximately 10 meters. According to archaeologists, it might have been an industrial building or a workshop.

Madras High Court intervenes

The matter made its way to the judiciary in the interim. Judges from the Madras High Court intervened and travelled to the excavation site. They asked the ASI to carry on with the excavations and permit the involvement of the Tamil Nadu Department of Archaeology. The archaeology department of the state followed the instruction.

It had been working on it since the third phase of excavation, giving a more dramatic turn to the events. The court’s Madurai bench in 2019 pronounced that the excavations should not stop since significant advancements in Tamil civilisation had been uncovered while considering a number of petitions that sought an order to the state and the centre to preserve the archaeological sites in Tamil Nadu.

The public would learn more about Tamil civilisation through the archaeological excavations, thus Division Bench consisting of Justices D. Krishnakumar and R. Vijayakumar advised the relevant authorities to ensure that they were carried out without any obstacles.

The court even ordered the centre to send back Amarnath Ramakrishna to Tamil Nadu within 15 days to continue the excavations. Amarnath Ramakrishna, who had been moved back to the state, put forth his report on the first two stages of excavation in January 2023.

Last year, the High Court even sent a notice to the centre demanding the ASI to release the report that was provided following the first two stages of the excavations. The centre received notice regarding the petition filed by Madurai resident P. Prabhakar Pandian from the bench.

The state and the centre were also instructed to submit more counter-affidavits to several public interest litigation petitions concerning the excavations, in the same year. It ordered the authorities to present the rebuttal affidavits to the 2016 and 2017 petitions which had asked the relevant authorities for guidance on how to proceed with the excavations at Keeladi rather than shutting down the site.

One of the petitions asked the government to establish a “site museum” at Keeladi. Stalin opened a Rs 18.43 crore Keeladi museum in March 2023 on two acres.

The Madurai bench even granted the Archaeological Survey India’s request to relocate the artefacts from the excavation to its Dehradun lab for further scientific analysis, in 2016. It was instructed to notify the state’s archaeology commissioner prior to the move. The commissioner was told to record videos and take pictures of the items. The ASI was given directions to return the objects to Tamil Nadu and provide a report to the court.

Controversy erupts between the Centre, Tamil Nadu govt

The 982-page final report was given by Ramakrishna in January 2023, following preliminary and interim submissions in 2016 and 2017, respectively. It had been with the ASI for almost two and a half years and it wrote to Ramakrishna in May seeking a revision.

The Archaeological Survey of India raised concerns regarding the dating and profoundity of specific outcomes. It underscored that the evidence for the earliest period seemed to be quite early and stated that it needed further examination.

According to the letter, “the three periods require proper nomenclatures or re-orientation.” It remarked that the “8th century BCE to 5th century BCE for Period I requires concrete justification.” It also noted that “just mentioning depth for the available scientific dates is not enough but the layer number should also be marked for comparative consistency analysis.” The ASI also demanded that the manner in which dates were presented should also be amended.

However, Amarnath Ramakrishna refused to modify his results, maintaining that his research was sound from a scientific standpoint and supported by strict archaeological standards. He maintained that material culture, stratigraphic sequences and even Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) corroborated the report’s chronology.

A number of Tamil Nadu political groups, including the ruling-Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), the Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi and historian R. Balakrishnan, denounced the ASI’s move as an attempt to stifle Tamil culture. They accused that the failure to recognise Keeladi’s importance was motivated by politics.

On the other hand, Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, the Union Minister for Culture, stated that additional scientific research was necessary to validate Ramakrishnan’s conclusions because they lacked technical support. He asserted that a single finding could not alter the entire discourse and therefore, more data, outcomes and proofs were needed to be collected.

Shekhawat stated that Tamil Nadu is a vital part of India and that its history should be honoured using knowledge based on science rather than polarising opinions. He informed Stalin that the union government would not hesitate to publish any reports and would be delighted to support the state if the research was validated by science.

The union minister declared that more convincing evidence is required for the report to be accepted by the scientific community. He even questioned was the Tamil Nadu government had been reluctant to work with the centre on this matter due to which the conflict has persisted.

“People holding such positions are trying to use that to grow regional sentiments. That is not fair. We have to be very cautious. Let archaeologists, historians, and technical experts discuss this, instead of politicians,” he mentioned.

However, Thangam Thennarasu, Tamil Nadu’s Archaeology Minister, charged that the union government treats Tamils as second-class citizens. He complained, “They also refused to allocate funds for the excavations and allowed the report to gather dust for two years. Now they say there is no adequate evidence. Every time they reject Tamil history, only the method of rejection changes.”

Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam’s (MDMK) Vaiko also claimed that the centre was attempting to promote “a non-existent Sanskrit civilisation” while repressing Tamil civilisation.

“How many obstacles do Tamils face? We have been fighting against all of them for thousands of years, and with the help of science, we have been establishing the antiquity of our race. Yet some minds refuse to accept it. It’s not the statements that need to be corrected, it’s some minds,” MK Stalin recently shared on social media last month while reacting on Ramakrishna’s recent transfer.

Communist Party of India (Marxist) MP from Madurai S Venkatesan expressed, “Transferring an official is not in itself a major issue, it is part of administrative procedures. But Amarnath Ramakrishna worked on the Keeladi excavation for eight years, without compromising on the truth. He was removed, reassigned and denied the opportunity to publish his findings. Only after court intervention was he allowed to write the report.”

He conveyed that the ASI had promised the court and Parliament that the report would be released in 11 months, but that deadline had not been fulfilled while the centre now wants more scientific proof at the final stage. “The message is clear: If you do not align with our views, this is what will be done to you. This is not just about an individual, it’s a discriminatory act against Tamil Nadu and against South Indian history itself,” he alleged.

The AIADMK (All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam) which was in power when the Keeladi report was issued, did not comment on the dispute for a long time. On 18th June, however, its senior leader and former minister RB Udhayakumar stated that the union government had requested further data in order to provide “additional corroboration.” He added that his party would be the first one to voice its disapproval if the Keeladi report was rejected.

Stalin accused the party of remaining silent while the centre minimised the importance of the location to which Udhayakumar retorted that his party’s government had approved Rs 55 lakh for the 2018 excavations. Mafoi Pandiarajan, a senior AIADMK leader who helmed archaeology under Edappadi Palaniswamy, praised him as “Keeladi Nayakar” (hero of Keeladi) and gave him credit for proving Tamil antiquity. A veteran DMK leader retaliated, “Their belated pride in Keeladi rings hollow when they put alliance politics above Tamil identity.”

Central government demands excavation report

The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has asked retired superintending archaeologist PS Sriraman to present the official excavation report for the third phase of the Keeladi excavations. He handled the short-lived third phase in 2017 after Ramakrishna’s abrupt transfer and reported that no major discoveries were made.

He retired in 2019 and has been given permission by the agency to write reports on the excavations he supervised in Keeladi, where he headed the third phase of excavations. He was also involved in the work for one season at Kodumanal which is situated on the northern banks of the Noyyal River in the Erode district, between 2017-2018.

According to archaeologists, Kodumanal could be split into two cultural periods: the Megalithic era and the Prehistoric era. During these times, the locals built durable structures, were skilled craftspeople and engaged in trade with several nations.

Sriraman would be writing the report from the ASI office in Chennai. He talked to The Hindu and revealed, “As I had retired, both reports were pending. I sought the approval of the ASI to access the material and prepare the reports. Since all the related materials are in Chennai, I will begin preparing the reports soon.”

He reiterated, “I have sought permission to complete the report since I am retired now. A formal communication from the ASI is expected soon,” while speaking with Deccan Herald. “The ASI instructed me to complete as quickly as possible. I am concentrating more on Kodumanal because it is an individual work – my work while the third phase in Keezhadi is for a shorter period and it was a continuation of work done earlier,” he asserted in conversation with The New Indian Express.

This comes more than a month after Ramakrishna was asked by the ASI to “resubmit” his report following the necessary changes recommended by two experts who reviewed it.

New dawn in India’s history: Traces of parallel civilization

The Keeladi site has unveiled a pivotal chapter in the history of Tamil Nadu. The indication that an artifact belonged to the 6th century BCE by the US laboratory Beta Analytics holds a major significance. They used the method of radiocarbon dating and suggested that it was contemporary with the urbanisation of the Gangetic plains.

The oldest of the 29 radiocarbon samples dated by the Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology since the 2017-18 excavation season was 580 BCE and the most recent was 200 CE. The results indicated that between the sixth century BCE and the second century CE, there was a vibrant urban and industrial civilisation that lasted for 800 years.

Large brick buildings from the Sangam Age had been discovered and provided proof of the development discussed in Sangam literature. Archaeologist K Rajan who is advisor to Tamil Nadu’s archaeology department voiced, “Most samples above the brick structures date to after the 3rd century BCE, while those below go as far back as the 6th century BCE,” reported The Times of India.

With the use of 3D technology and anthropometric measurements from a skull discovered at the Kondagai burial site, archaeologists are one step closer to unveiling the face of the ancient Tamil people who inhabited the Keeladi settlement thousands of years ago. Rajan stated, “Based on the skull, we will reconstruct the age, dietary pattern, determine the gender, and actual face of the person.”

He added, “This places Keeladi alongside the urbanisation of the Gangetic plains, India’s second urbanisation. Of the 29 radiocarbon dates, 12 fall in the pre-Ashokan era, before the 3rd century BCE.”

Over 20 research institutions from India and abroad are working with the state archaeology department to recreate life in Keeladi in 580 BCE. These involve Liverpool University in the United Kingdom, the University of Pisa in Italy, the Field Museum in Chicago, the French Institute of Pondicherry, IIT Gandhinagar and Deccan College.

Animal bones discovered in Keeladi are under examination at the Deccan College. The bones of bulls, buffaloes, goats, cows, sheep, dogs, pigs, antelope and spotted deer were located during excavations. Researchers at Madurai Kamaraj University are looking into ancient animal and human DNA in order to gain further insight into the mixing and human migration of the ancient residents of Keeladi and Kondagai, a Keeladi cluster hamlet.

A single site has produced 29 dates applying this scientific method. “It shows Keeladi was an urban settlement with a literate society and a community of artisans. It was an industrial hub along an ancient trade route linking the east coast port of Alagankulam to Muziris on the west coast via Madurai,” mentioned R Sivanandam, joint director of state archaeology department.

However, the settlement’s original name is still unknown. Towns, streets, palace structures, decorations, gemstones and international trade are part of Sangam literature. “Keeladi has proved that Sangam literature was a lived experience of ancient Tamils and not imaginative stories,” conveyed indologist R Balakrishnan.

At the site, archaeologists uncovered rectangular and cubic pieces of clay and ivory dice that, according to Balakrishnan, are referenced in “Kalithogai” the sixth of the eight anthologies of Sangam literature.

Rajan emphasised, “Keeladi isn’t the only site with roots in the 6th century BCE. Kodumanal, Porunthal, Sivagalai, Adichanallur and Korkai have also yielded dates from that period. Korkai has produced a date as early as 785 BCE, suggesting Sangam-age urbanisation was widespread.”

Only 4% of the 110 acres of cultural deposit at Keeladi have been unearthed by researchers in ten seasons of excavation. The state government intends to execute further excavations and has established a museum to display the discoveries. There are also plans for an on-site museum which will be the first of its sort in the country.

“Tamil Nadu has endured archaeological apathy for far too long until Keeladi sparked a wave of interest among Tamils,” complained Balakrishnan. Rajan expressed, “Keeladi is the first site that transformed the understanding of archaeology in Tamil Nadu.”

Faces from Keeladi

Meanwhile, a first-of-its-kind forensic facial reconstruction project coordinated by experts from Madurai Kamaraj University and Liverpool John Moores University restored the faces of two individuals who lived in the Keeladi region more than 2,500 years ago. Researchers described the facial features as South Indian with signs of ancient Austro-Asiatic people and West Eurasian (Iranian) hunter-gatherers.

The skulls were discovered around 800 meters from the main excavation site at Kondagai, a burial site. They added that more DNA research is required to identify the genetic ancestry.

Professor Caroline Wilkinson, director of Face Lab at Liverpool John Moores University informed, “We used a computer-assisted 3D facial reconstruction system to rebuild the facial musculature and estimate facial features following anatomical and anthropometrical standards. . As the lower jaws of the skulls were missing, we used orthodontic standards to estimate the shapes of the mandibles from cranial measurements and planes,” according to a report in The Times of India.

According to professor G Kumaresan of Madurai Kamaraj University’s genetics department which scanned and sent pictures of the skulls to Liverpool, “It is 80% science and 20% art.” He outlined that the DNA information and the recreated faces could be useful in determining the lineage of Tamils who lived during the Sangam era.

Critical moment in India’s civilisational journey

The 90-by-60-meter excavated area contains artefacts like as dice, unidentified copper coins, glass, shell, ivory, pearl, and terracotta beads, seals and gold decorations. More importantly, it is one of the few locations in Tamil Nadu, along with Arikamedu, Kaveripattinam and Korkai, to produce a broad range of structures, including intricate brick constructions, tank-like drainage systems, double-walled furnaces and terracotta ring wells.

All of this not only indicates a vibrant, literate and successful urbanized community but also emphasizes the advanced nature of Indian civilization. Its origins trace back to the timeline of the Gangetic plains which also illuminate how India has been home to not just one but multiple prime civilizations and flourishing communities residing in both the northern and southern regions of this vast country for many centuries. Furthermore, the discoveries indicated that they were also linked to the external world.

Such developments not only reinforce the deep civilizational roots of this ancient country but also aid in comprehending the elements of our age-old society. The myths surrounding foreigners who landed in the country and established their communities are also debunked by these revelations, which confirm that the nation has been the cradle of multiple ancient advanced settlements displaying city planning, trade, leisure and all indications of a vibrant cultural society.

These discoveries are therefore not merely a matter of pride but are crucial in preserving our civilizational foundations, comprehending and sustaining a continuous connection with our past, as well as understanding our background. Certainly, the sophisticated perspective of our forebears and the societies they formed and preserved over centuries is truly a subject of admiration.

Intellectuals, historians, epigraphists, geologists and archaeology aficionados have all been drawn to Keeladi to analyse the historical relevance it provides to society and it has even prompted several research investigations.

OpIndia,20/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/telangana-brs-government-tappedphones-of-more-than-600-people-before-vidhan-sabha-election-2023-details/,"Telangana: BRS govt tapped phones of more than 600 people, including Opposition politicians, before 2023 Vidhan Sabha election","During the run-up to the 2023 Assembly elections, the Special Investigation Team (SIT) has found that the Special Operations Team (SOT) of Telangana’s Special Intelligence Bureau (SIB) has tapped the phones of at least 600 individuals. Many of them belong to political leaders from the opposition.

According to Indian Express sources, the tapping took place from 16th November to 30th November, 2023, the day the Assembly elections were held in the state. “While the tapping, according to confessions and investigation into the case, allegedly started in 2018-19, we have evidence that proves that for 15 days before the state assembly elections, at least 600 individuals were placed under surveillance without cause,” a top-ranked police officer told the Indian Express.

Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee president Mahesh Kumar Goud and BJP leader and Union Minister for State Bandi Sanjay Kumar have been summoned by the Hyderabad police to depose. It indicates that their phones may have been under surveillance.

In March 2024, allegations of phone tapping first surfaced when an ASP of SIB lodged an FIR against DSP Praneeth Rao at Hyderabad’s Punjagutta police station. He accused him of using illegal means to gather intelligence.

The Punjagutta police have named six accused in the case. The SIT is set to question former Special Intelligence Bureau (SIB) chief T Prabhakar Rao, alongside Praneeth Rao, ASP M Thirupathanna and N Bhujanga Rao, former DCP T Radha Kishan Rao, and television channel owner N Shravan Kumar. The questioning will likely involve naming individuals whose phones were allegedly tapped.

The Supreme Court has granted Prabhakar Rao relief from arrest till August, while D Praneeth Rao, Bhujanga Rao, M Thirupathanna and T Radha Kishan Rao were arrested and later released on bail. N Shravan Kumar is currently lodged in Chanchalguda jail in a separate case. He, too, has been granted relief from arrest by the Supreme Court in the phone tapping case. The former SIB chief has been questioned several times, including the most recent one on 16th July.

According to sources, a major challenge for the investigators is that every six months, the SIB’s special operation team destroys surveillance records. “The SIB’s job is to investigate left-wing extremism. They only keep surveillance on people linked to the Maoists. In this case, the SIB is accused of keeping surveillance on unconnected individuals for political reasons as well,” the official said.

The surveillance was carried out by misusing Section 419(A) of the Indian Telegraph Rules. The Rules state: “No direction for the interception of any message or class of messages under sub-section (2) of section 5 of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 (hereinafter referred to as the said (Act)) shall be issued except under an order made by the Secretary to the Government of India in the Ministry of Home Affairs in the case of the Government of India and by the Secretary to the State Government in charge of the Home Department in the case of a State Government”.

A legal expert of the Hyderabad police explained, “The rules, however, give a relaxation that in the case of emergency or unavoidable circumstances, such order may be made by an officer, not below the rank of a Joint Secretary to the Government of India, who has been duly authorised by the Union Home Secretary or the State Home Secretary”.",run 2023 assembly election special investigation team sit found special operation team sot telangana’s special intelligence bureau sib tapped phone least 600 individual many belong political leader opposition according indian express source tapping took place 16th november 30th november 2023 day assembly election held state “while tapping according confession investigation case allegedly started 2018 19 evidence prof 15 day state assembly election least 600 individual placed surveillance without cause ” top ranked police officer told indian express telangana pradesh congress committee president mahesh kumar goud bjp leader union minister state bandi sanjay kumar summoned hyderabad police depose indicates phone may surveillance march 2024 allegation phone tapping first surfaced asp sib lodged fir dsp praneeth rao hyderabad’s punjagutta police station accused using illegal mean gather intelligence punjagutta police named six accused case sit set question former special intelligence bureau sib chief prabhakar rao alongside praneeth rao asp thirupathanna n bhujanga rao former dcp radha kishan rao television channel owner n shravan kumar questioning likely involve naming individual whose phone allegedly tapped supreme court granted prabhakar rao relief arrest till august praneeth rao bhujanga rao thirupathanna radha kishan rao arrested later released bail n shravan kumar currently lodged chanchalguda jail separate case granted relief arrest supreme court phone tapping case former sib chief questioned several time including recent one 16th july according source major challenge investigator every six month sib’s special operation team destroys surveillance record “the sib’s job investigate left wing extremism keep surveillance people linked maoist case sib accused keeping surveillance unconnected individual political reason well ” official said surveillance carried misusing section 419 indian telegraph rule rule state “no direction interception message class message sub section 2 section 5 indian telegraph act 1885 hereinafter referred said act shall issued except order made secretary government india ministry home affair case government india secretary state government charge home department case state government” legal expert hyderabad police explained “the rule however give relaxation case emergency unavoidable circumstance order may made officer rank joint secretary government india duly authorised union home secretary state home secretary”

The High Court has issued special guidelines in this regard for judicial officers and others.

The High Court has directed that cloud-based AI tools, such as ChatGPT, should not be used to issue orders, and action will be taken if these guidelines are violated. The guidelines also clarify that AI should not be used to reach conclusions or issue orders or judgments.

The High Court has directed that caution should be exercised, as there is a possibility of errors while using AI tools.

Proper training should be obtained in using AI tools. For this, one should attend a training program held at the Judicial Academy or the High Court. If AI tools are used, they should be approved only. There should be supervision at every stage of use.

The High Court has also clarified that if any anomaly is noticed in the approved AI tools, the IT department of the High Court should be informed. This is the first time that a High Court has issued such an instruction in the country.

Earlier on July 16, the Kerala High Court quashed the driving license exam reforms introduced by the State Transport Commissioner.

The move came after a petition was filed by driving schools, arguing that the new instructions were illogical, unilaterally imposed, and included vehicle bans.

The driving school owners argued that the norms announced were an encroachment on the jurisdiction of the Centre. Accepting this, the High Court single bench quashed the circular issued by the Transport Commissioner and the related orders.

The Kerala government may appeal the decision before a division bench.

The driving license exam reform included increasing the number of license exams to 30 per day and creating a new track, replacing the H Test with a new method.

The recommendations included that vehicles older than 15 years should not be used for tests, and vehicles with foot gears should not be used for two-wheeler license exams.

The announcement also prohibited automatic vehicles and electric cars from being used for the car license exam.

What is World Championship of Legends

The WCL is a cricket tournament that features famous retired international stars from various cricketing nations. It is sanctioned by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB). The 2025 edition runs from 18th July to 2nd August across the four venues in the UK. The participating teams are from India, Pakistan, England, the West Indies, South Africa, and Australia. India is the defending champion, defeating Pakistan in the 2024 final.

Background: The Pahalgam attack and Operation Sindoor

On 22nd April 2025, in a cowardly act, several Pakistani terrorists invaded the Baisaran valley of Pahalgam. They brutally killed 26 Hindus based on their religion. The attack was claimed by The Resistance Front (TRF), an offshoot of the Pakistan-based terrorist organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba.

On 7th May, in response, India launched Operation Sindoor, a fully-fledged cross-border anti terrorist operation, targeting and destroying multiple terror camps in Pakistan via missile strikes.

The event organisers of WCL have confirmed that tomorrow’s match between India and Pakistan (Sunday 20th July at 16.30) has been cancelled. Please do not attend as the stadium will be closed.

Why was the match cancelled

The match was cancelled after key Indian players refused to play against Pakistan. Shikhar Dhawan publicly shared an email dated 11th May, 2025, affirming his stance: “My country is everything; nothing is above the nation”

Apart from that, the tournament sponsor EaseMyTrip also declared it would boycott all matches involving Pakistan, emphasising its “Bharat First” policy.

In a viral social media post, Pakistani Captain Shahid Afridi made a derogatory remark on the Pahalgam terror attack. He told the local reporters in Pakistan, “The terrorists continued to kill people in Pahalgam for an hour, and not a single Indian soldier out of 8 lakh showed up.

OpIndia,20/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/balrampur-conversion-racket-jalaluddin-islamist-network-india/,"How the Balrampur conversion racket exposes the modus operandi of sexual harassment, blackmail, and a foreign-funded Islamist network in India","The Uttar Pradesh Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) has busted a massive Islamic conversion racket operation running from Balrampur district. The racket was being run by a man named Jalaluddin who called himself Chhangur Baba. The racket is one of the largest Islamisation networks uncovered in recent Indian history involving over Rs 100 crores in foreign funding and was not limited to religious conversions. It included blackmail, sexual exploitation, land encroachment and links to criminal foreign intelligence syndicates.

Jalaluddin was running the racket along with his wife and other family members. He was arrested on 5th July from Gomti Nagar. His son, Mehboob, and close aides were arrested in April. He operated under the guise of a Sufi saint near Chand Auliya Dargah and even authored a religious book titled “Shijra-e-Tayyaba” to project himself as a spiritual leader. Interestingly, despite their conversion to Islam, the family maintained Hindu identities in official documents including passports and property records.

Several FIRs have been registered across multiple districts. Reportedly, his network lured at least 40 individuals, mostly Hindu girls, into Islam through coercion, deceit and sexual relationships. Muslim men were paid to take on Hindu identities, lure young Hindu women, and then marry them through nikah ceremonies arranged by Jalaluddin. Many of the victims of his network were minors. The incentive paid to Muslim men to lure Hindu girls was based on the caste of the victim. If the girl lured to convert to Islam was a Brahmin, Sikh, or Kshatriya, the incentive to be paid was Rs 15–16 lakh. Similarly, Rs 10–12 lakhs for OBCs and Rs 8–10 lakh for others.

The ATS recovered a diary that contained over 100 names marked as potential targets. Properties worth crores, showrooms, luxury cars and multiple foreign trips, specifically to Gulf countries, were revealed during the investigation, highlighting the extent of his illicit wealth. The ATS also found that he had travelled abroad over 40 times, while his close associate, Neetu (later converted to Nasreen), made 19 trips to the UAE between 2014 and 2019. However, discrepancies in travel and conversion certificates raised questions about document forgery.

A house of lies – Encroachment and blackmail

Jalaluddin’s Balrampur base was built on deception. The 3-bigha bungalow, which authorities demolished on 8th July, was an illegal structure registered under Nasreen’s name. It housed the converted Rohra family, Ghanshyam (now Jamaluddin), Neetu (Nasreen) and daughter Samale (Sabiha), who had earlier owned the property. The bungalow was not the only illegal property linked to Jalaluddin. A nearby college, hospital and madarsa built on Gram Samaj land were also bulldozed.

The extent of blackmail came to light through the account of a Hindu man named Sanchit who worked as a sweeper at Jalaluddin’s house. He was offered Rs 5 lakh, a house, and a motorcycle to convert. When he refused, he was threatened, falsely implicated in rape charges, and his wife jailed on fabricated grounds.

A network of front organisations and foreign accounts

The conversion racket was not based on ideology alone. It was fuelled by organised financial engineering. Jalaluddin created bogus entities like Aasvi Enterprises, Aasvi Charitable Trust, and Baba Tajuddin Aasvi Boutique to launder foreign funds. These funds were funnelled through at least 40 bank accounts that involved suspicious NEFT transactions and direct international transfers. He even deposited Rs 6 lakh from an Indian bank account into a foreign one.

One of his associates, Idul Islam from Pune, helped in expanding the network in Maharashtra. The ATS identified a Rs 16 crore property in Lonavala registered under an associate, which revealed the scale of interstate operations.

CM Yogi and law enforcement respond

Following the revelation of the racket, Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Yogi Adityanath, issued a strong statement. He assured that every illegal asset would be confiscated and the guilty would be punished as per the law. He promised “exemplary punishment”, especially for those who endangered women’s safety and disturbed societal harmony.

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has now registered a case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) and joined the ATS and STF in a coordinated multi-agency investigation. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) may soon follow suit.

The deeper malaise – A sample of Islamist nexus in India

The Balrampur racket is not an isolated incident. It is merely a sample of the Islamist conversion nexus operating in India. The model used by Jalaluddin is similar to other known cases, including the infamous Beawar Muslim gang in Rajasthan. Both cases involved the targeting of school-going Hindu girls, caste-based conversion incentives, fake Hindu identities, sexual exploitation, and conversion through deceit.

Further investigations into the network have revealed Jalaluddin’s ties to international Islamist groups, including Saudi Arabia Islamic Development Bank, Dawat-e-Islam, Muslim World League, and the Islamic Union of Nepal. He even collaborated with Christian missionary groups operating along the India-Nepal border, reportedly paying them for data on vulnerable Hindu families. This inter-religious collaboration aimed solely at religious conversion highlights a disturbing new trend.

Reports have revealed that Jalaluddin has links with Pakistan’s ISI, identifying him as part of Mission Aabaad. It is a systematic plan to alter India’s demography through conversion. The presence of caste-based pricing, foreign funding, links to gangsters like Mukhtar Ansari, and document forgery all point to a powerful and well-connected syndicate.

The nexus is not just religious, it is criminal, financial, and political. From benami land deals and forged identity documents to mafia ties and encroachments, it reveals how these networks quietly embed themselves in society and operate with impunity. The complicity or negligence of local authorities allowed this racket to thrive for nearly 15 years.

While bulldozers have razed illegal structures, police have arrested several key accused, and agencies like ED and ATS are tracing the flow of foreign money, it is now clear that India now stares at an uncomfortable reality. Religious conversions have become a multi-crore industry. It is fuelled by international funds, caste-based targeting, sexual blackmail and deep ideological penetration.

The Balrampur conversion racket is not just a case of forced religious change but a chilling exposé of how Islamist syndicates operate in India. From grooming and sexual exploitation of minors to caste-based pricing for conversions, the racket reveals a structured pattern of harassment and blackmail. Backed by Rs 100 crore in foreign funding and aided by forged identities, bogus trusts, and missionary data, the operation reflects a well-oiled machinery designed to alter India’s demography. This case demonstrates how such networks exploit vulnerable populations while evading authorities, reinforcing the need to dismantle every arm of this deep-rooted Islamist nexus.

Implications for national security and communal harmony

As the probe into Jalaluddin’s network gets intense, the inclusion of terrorism-related charges cannot be ruled out. It is clear that there is a connection to foreign intelligence and funding. The evident demographic agenda has made it a serious national security concern. The Balrampur case has reaffirmed that there is a need for strict scrutiny of foreign-funded NGOs, religious trusts, and educational institutions that operate without accountability.

Furthermore, there is a need for cultural introspection. Why are India’s vulnerable communities repeatedly targeted and coerced into leaving their faith? And why have successive governments ignored this pacing undercurrent?

Jalaluddin’s downfall must serve as a warning bell and it has to be understood that this is not the last nexus busted in India. Without structural reform, stronger legislation, and vigilant enforcement, more “Chhangur Babas” will rise while hiding behind saffron names. They will construct illegal empires under the noses of administration, slowly chipping away at India’s social fabric. The conversion racket in Balrampur is no anomaly, it is a blueprint.

“For over a year now, Sameer Mursil Khan, the Assistant Finance Officer, has been repeatedly harassing me. Sometimes he says, ‘Go back,’ or asks, ‘Who is this tilak-wearing person?’ He even says the tilak is getting bigger day by day. He interferes in our office matters even when I have no orders. He sits and interrupts, telling suppliers what to do when I have no authority over orders,” Sharma told the media on Saturday (19th July).

The victim said that Khan has been threatening him and said, “You do not know about my background. Don’t take me lightly. My father has served as president here.” He said that whenever he goes to Khan’s office to hand over a parcel, he is not allowed to enter. Sharma said that he is fearing for his life because of Khan’s threats. His family are also scared and asking him to leave the job.

Sharma said that he has a right to practice his religion and therefore he has filed a complaint with the university authorities, including the Vice-Chancellor and the Registrar, regarding the harassment and religious discrimination by Khan. He said that, if needed, he would approach the local member of Parliament.

Ashish Sharma has been working at the college for seven years. He said that due to religious discrimination, he has not received his overdue salary appraisal and promotion and unfair restrictions are imposed on him.

OpIndia,19/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/rajdeep-sardesai-lies-about-chhatrapati-shivaji-maharaj-to-whitewash-mughal-atrocities/,Rajdeep Sardesai lies about Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj to whitewash Mughal atrocities: When false moral equivalence becomes historical slander,"In an alarming demonstration of distorting history, India Today journalist Rajdeep Sardesai has once again stirred controversy—this time by misrepresenting the legacy of one of India’s most revered historical icons, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. During a recent episode of ‘Democratic Newsroom’ on India Today, Sardesai appeared so rattled over the latest NCERT textbook revisions initiated by the central government that he didn’t mind employing lies to achieve false moral equivalence between Mughal tyrants and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.

While the changes in textbooks, among other things, aim to bring more balance and historical accuracy by highlighting the brutalities of Mughal invaders, facts long suppressed or sanitised in earlier educational narratives, it has also veritably triggered a meltdown among leftwing ‘intellectuals’, with Rajdeep’s angry rant perfectly embodying the complete disregard of historical facts concerning Hindu cultural and historical icons among the left echo chamber.

In his attempt to defend the discredited, Mughal-centric version of Indian history, Sardesai launched into a bizarre tirade, drawing false equivalences between the reign of Shivaji Maharaj and that of the Mughals. Sardesai argued that all medieval rulers, including Shivaji, were driven by political compulsions of the times, an oversimplification that serves only one purpose: to blur the civilizational distinction between native guardians of dharma like Shivaji and foreign invaders like Mughals.

Rajeep @sardesairajdeep slanders Shivaji Maharaj.



He says ""Shivaji raided Bengal. He didn't differentiate between Hindus and Muslims. He looted all people. Just like Mughals"" (Timestamp 1.58).



FOOL,



Shivaji Maharaj never set his foot in Bengal. Neither did Shivaji's armies. pic.twitter.com/n3F1pelOT4 — True Indology (@TrueIndology) July 19, 2025

But in doing so, Rajdeep went a step too far. He alleged that Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was a dacoit and his army had wreaked havoc during raids on Bengal. This is not just factually incorrect; it is a blatant lie.

The truth: Shivaji never invaded Bengal

Historical records, including those by both Indian and foreign chroniclers, unanimously state that Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj never invaded Bengal, nor did his army conduct raids in that region. Shivaji’s military campaigns were primarily focused on liberating large parts of the Deccan and western India from Mughal and Sultanate control. His resistance was largely confined to the oppressive regimes of Bijapur, Golconda, and especially the Mughals under Aurangzeb.

If there is no credible record of Maratha activity in Bengal during Shivaji’s time, what then was the basis of Rajdeep Sardesai’s claim? None. It appears to be a calculated fabrication aimed at manufacturing moral equivalence between Hindu warrior kings and Islamic invaders whose campaigns were drenched in blood, temple destruction, and forced conversions.

A false equivalence meant to whitewash Mughal crimes

By drawing such false comparisons, Rajdeep is not merely misinforming the public; he is engaged in a subtle but dangerous propaganda effort to trivialise the genocidal violence committed by the Mughals against Hindus and other non-Muslims. Unlike Shivaji, whose campaigns were focused on defensive warfare, protection of the native population, and establishing Hindavi Swarajya (self-rule), the Mughals, especially Aurangzeb, were driven by an explicitly Islamic supremacist fantasy of turning India into an Islamic nation. Temples were occupied, razed, women were abducted and put into harems, and Hindus were taxed, converted, or killed.

There is no recorded instance where Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s forces indulged in mass rape, temple desecration, or religious persecution. In fact, he was known for his chivalry, especially toward women, and often went out of his way to protect the honour of those captured during warfare, a code of ethics absent from the Mughal playbook.

Political bias masquerading as journalism

This episode raises uncomfortable questions about the ideological lens through which certain sections of Indian media view history. Rajdeep Sardesai’s remarks were not rooted in ignorance, but were entrenched in clear intent to undermine nationalist historical consciousness, which is gaining ground through textbook corrections and contemporary public discourse where questions are raised over celebrations of Mughal tyrants and maintaining tombs commemorating them.

However, Rajdeep’s statements on Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj is symbolic of a larger pattern: an entrenched elite class that views native Indian rulers with contempt while romanticising Muslim invaders, rationalising their atrocities as the “order of the day”, and drawing false moral equivalences and lies to buttress their contentions. This intellectual dishonesty is not only disrespectful to historical truth but also an affront to national sentiment.

History must be respected, not manipulated

As India reclaims its civilisational narrative and corrects decades of systematic historical distortion perpetrated by Nehruvian Marxists, public intellectuals and journalists must act responsibly. Criticism of government policies is welcome in a democracy, but spreading outright lies about national heroes like Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj crosses all lines of journalistic ethics, which some ‘journalists’ seem to have abandoned, especially after Modi came to power for the third term in 2024.

Rajdeep Sardesai owes an apology, not just to the people of Maharashtra, but to all Indians who take pride in their history and heroes. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was not just a king; he was a symbol of resistance against tyranny, a guardian of dharma, and a beacon of just rule. Any attempt to stain his legacy with falsehoods and slanderous allegations must be exposed, condemned, and corrected.",alarming demonstration distorting history india today journalist rajdeep sardesai stirred controversy—this time misrepresenting legacy one india’s revered historical icon chhatrapati shivaji maharaj recent episode ‘democratic newsroom’ india today sardesai appeared rattled latest ncert textbook revision initiated central government didn’t mind employing lie achieve false moral equivalence mughal tyrant chhatrapati shivaji maharaj change textbook among thing aim bring balance historical accuracy highlighting brutality mughal invader fact long suppressed sanitised earlier educational narrative also veritably triggered meltdown among leftwing ‘intellectuals’ rajdeep’s angry rant perfectly embodying complete disregard historical fact concerning hindu cultural historical icon among left echo chamber attempt defend discredited mughal centric version indian history sardesai launched bizarre tirade drawing false equivalence reign shivaji maharaj mughals sardesai argued medieval ruler including shivaji driven political compulsion time oversimplification serf one purpose blur civilizational distinction native guardian dharma like shivaji foreign invader like mughals rajeep sardesairajdeep slander shivaji maharaj say shivaji raided bengal differentiate hindu muslim looted people like mughals timestamp 1 58 fool shivaji maharaj never set foot bengal neither shivaji army pic twitter com n3f1pelot4 — true indology trueindology july 19 2025 rajdeep went step far alleged chhatrapati shivaji maharaj dacoit army wreaked havoc raid bengal factually incorrect blatant lie truth shivaji never invaded bengal historical record including indian foreign chronicler unanimously state chhatrapati shivaji maharaj never invaded bengal army conduct raid region shivaji’s military campaign primarily focused liberating large part deccan western india mughal sultanate control resistance largely confined oppressive regime bijapur golconda especially mughals aurangzeb credible record maratha activity bengal shivaji’s time basis rajdeep sardesai’s claim none appears calculated fabrication aimed manufacturing moral equivalence hindu warrior king islamic invader whose campaign drenched blood temple destruction forced conversion false equivalence meant whitewash mughal crime drawing false comparison rajdeep merely misinforming public engaged subtle dangerous propaganda effort trivialise genocidal violence committed mughals hindu non muslim unlike shivaji whose campaign focused defensive warfare protection native population establishing hindavi swarajya self rule mughals especially aurangzeb driven explicitly islamic supremacist fantasy turning india islamic nation temple occupied razed woman abducted put harem hindu taxed converted killed recorded instance chhatrapati shivaji maharaj’s force indulged mass rape temple desecration religious persecution fact known chivalry especially toward woman often went way protect honour captured warfare code ethic absent mughal playbook political bias masquerading journalism episode raise uncomfortable question ideological lens certain section indian medium view history rajdeep sardesai’s remark rooted ignorance entrenched clear intent undermine nationalist historical consciousness gaining ground textbook correction contemporary public discourse question raised celebration mughal tyrant maintaining tomb commemorating however rajdeep’s statement chhatrapati shivaji maharaj symbolic larger pattern entrenched elite class view native indian ruler contempt romanticising muslim invader rationalising atrocity “order day” drawing false moral equivalence lie buttress contention intellectual dishonesty disrespectful historical truth also affront national sentiment history must respected manipulated india reclaims civilisational narrative corrects decade systematic historical distortion perpetrated nehruvian marxist public intellectual journalist must act responsibly criticism government policy welcome democracy spreading outright lie national hero like chhatrapati shivaji maharaj cross line journalistic ethic ‘journalists’ seem abandoned especially modi came power third term 2024 rajdeep sardesai owes apology people maharashtra indian take pride history hero chhatrapati shivaji maharaj king symbol resistance tyranny guardian dharma beacon rule attempt stain legacy falsehood slanderous allegation must exposed condemned corrected
OpIndia,19/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/isis-style-conversion-racket-busted-up-police-pan-india-islamic-radicalization-syndicate-10-arrested/,"ISIS-style conversion racket busted: UP Police exposes pan-India Islamic radicalization syndicate; 10 accused linked to PFI, SDPI arrested","In a major nationwide crackdown under the Yogi Adityanath-led Mission Asmita initiative, the Uttar Pradesh Anti-Terror Squad (ATS) has busted a large-scale Islamic religious conversion and radicalisation syndicate that operated with tactics mirroring those of the ISIS. The racket, which spanned across six Indian states, involved terror funding through the dark web and targeted vulnerable Hindu women and minors through coercion, deception, and ‘love jihad’.

The operation led to the arrest of ten individuals from Delhi, Goa, West Bengal, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, and Uttar Pradesh.

The arrests come close on the heels of another major bust in Balrampur earlier this month, where Jalaluddin alias Chhangur Baba was nabbed for spearheading a foreign-funded conversion racket involving over ₹100 crore in remittances and incentives for mass conversions.

AK-47, Love Jihad, and ISIS-style tactics

The current investigation began in Agra in March after two sisters, aged 33 and 18, went missing. The case soon snowballed into the exposure of a pan-India jihadi network. According to Agra Police Commissioner Deepak Kumar, one of the sisters had even uploaded a social media profile photo of a girl holding an AK-47, signalling links to terror ideologies. The police suspect that she was radicalised online and recruited into an ISIS-inspired module targeting minor girls.

The network is believed to have channeled funds through illegal routes including the dark web, with financial trails traced to Canada, the United States, London, and Dubai.

“Their methods — coercion, grooming, love jihad, and brainwashing — bear the unmistakable signature of ISIS,” said Uttar Pradesh DGP Rajeev Krishna, adding that several of the accused were linked to banned Islamist outfits such as the Popular Front of India (PFI) and the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI).

Accused operated in multiple states

The 10 accused arrested by the Agra Police from Delhi, Goa, West Bengal, Uttarakhand, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh, have been identified as Aisha alias S.B. Krishna (Kolkata, West Bengal), Osama (Kolkata, West Bengal), Rehman Qureshi (Agra, UP), Abbu Tariq (Muzaffarnagar, UP), Abdur Rehman (Dehradun, Uttarakhand), Mohammad Ali (Jaipur, Rajasthan), Junaid Qureshi (Jaipur Rajasthan), Mustafa alias Manoj (Delhi), and Mohammad Ali (Jaipur, Rajasthan).

Accused arrested in Islamic conversion racket

They face charges under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (Sections 87, 111(3), and 111(4)) and the UP Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Act, 2021.

Foreign funding, ISI, and Christian Missionary links

Earlier this month, in a separate yet connected case, Jalaluddin alias Chhangur Baba was arrested in Balrampur for running an elaborate conversion racket funded by over ₹100 crore from Gulf countries. His network provided caste-based incentives to Muslim men who managed to convert Hindu women. Investigations also revealed his links to Pakistan’s ISI and local Christian missionary groups operating in Uttar Pradesh.

Mission Asmita: Coordinated crackdown on conversion syndicates

The entire operation is part of Mission Asmita, a state-wide campaign initiated by the UP Government to eliminate threats to national security stemming from foreign-funded religious conversions, radicalisation, and communal subversion.

As DGP Krishna confirmed, coordination with national agencies is ongoing, and custodial remand for the accused will be sought to unravel the full scope of the conspiracy.

The move follows Moraes’s order restricting Bolsonaro–mandating an ankle monitor, barring foreign contacts, and house arrest outside daylight hours–after accusations of seeking U.S. support to destabilize Brazil, The Washington Post said. Justice Moraes also barred Bolsonaro from contacting foreign governments and individuals under investigation, intensifying the scrutiny around Brazil’s judicial handling of his case.

U.S. Secretary of State and current President Trump asserted that the visa revocation was a response to what he described as a “political witch hunt” against Bolsonaro, alleging it violated basic rights and overreached beyond Brazil’s borders, according to The Washington Post. The sanctions reportedly also extend to Moraes’s allies and their immediate families.

The unprecedented diplomatic spat comes amid a wider rift involving trade tensions. On July 9, President Trump imposed a 50 percent tariff on Brazilian imports, citing concerns over free speech suppression under Moraes’s leadership, The Washington Post highlighted.

Moraes’s campaign against online misinformation–including the takedown of over a hundred social media accounts–has sparked criticism from Bolsonaro supporters who claim the judge wields the Supreme Court as a tool for political persecution, The Washington Post added. The judge accuses Bolsonaro and his son, Congressman Eduardo, of conspiring with foreign powers to intimidate Brazil’s judiciary, a charge Eduardo described as a continuation of a pattern of authoritarian behavior.

Legal analysts expressed skepticism about the U.S. invoking the Magnitsky Act–a sanction tool targeting human rights abuses–in this context, calling its use against Moraes questionable, The Washington Post reported. Despite the brewing confrontation, it remains unclear how many foreign nations Moraes visits or whether the visa revocation will significantly impact him personally.

Tensions continue as both countries dig in. Bolsonaro and his supporters have amplified their efforts to seek further U.S. intervention, including sanctions under the Magnitsky framework. Meanwhile, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has condemned Bolsonaro’s allies domestically, calling them traitors to national interests.

The dispute underscores deepening discord between Brazil and its longstanding ally, the U.S., with political, trade and judicial disagreements showing little sign of resolution.

She passed away on July 18, Friday, reportedly after writing a suicide note. The note accuses two professors and the university administration of mental harassment. The two staff members, Mahinder and Shairy, have been arrested so far.

In the suicide letter, she wrote that she had been mentally harassed and humiliated for a long time, which caused her significant distress. She expressed her desire for the accused to face legal action. She held the teachers of PCP and Dental Materials responsible for her death.

The note reads, “They mentally harassed me. They humiliated me. I have been under stress because of them for a long time. I want them to face the same thing. I am sorry. I can’t live like this anymore. I can’t…”

Shortly after the incident came to light, students gathered and protested against the university administration, alleging negligence. They claimed Jyoti had been under immense stress due to accusations of forging signatures. A minor scuffle broke out between the protesters and the police, while the family of the deceased was seen manhandling the head of the dentistry department.

The incident occurred on Friday night, and a case has been filed at the Knowledge Park Police Station in Gautam Buddha Nagar. “The woman’s body has been sent for post-mortem, and two staff members of the university have been arrested on the basis of a complaint filed by the victim’s family,” said Additional DCP of Greater Noida, Sudhir Kumar.

He added that tension had escalated due to the anger among the deceased’s family and university students towards the administration. The anger and scuffle were defused by the police through dialogue, and peace was restored at the scene. Further legal proceedings are underway.

Dr. Ajit Kumar, the university’s Public Relations Officer, confirmed that two faculty members have been suspended. “For now, two teachers have been suspended. A committee has also been formed to investigate the matter. Action will be taken against those found guilty based on the committee’s report,” he stated.

This is not an isolated case of a student taking her life due to harassment. A similar incident took place in Odisha’s Balasore shocking self-immolation case on July 12. A 20-year-old girl set herself on fire, allegedly after enduring sexual harassment by the head of her college department. She suffered 90 percent burns and later succumbed to her injuries at AIIMS Bhubaneswar on July 14.

These brutal incidents show no discrimination based on gender or age. This was evident in the tragic case of a teenager from The Global Public School in Kerala who ended his life after reportedly being bullied, assaulted, and harassed by his schoolmates.

According to the teenager’s mother, on January 15, he was forcibly taken to the toilet and made to lick the seat; his head was then pushed into the toilet while it was flushed. He was also bullied for his skin tone. The relentless harassment severely affected his mental health, ultimately driving him to end his life by jumping from the 26th floor of their apartment building.

On April 30, 2023, a 16-year-old boy died by suicide after allegedly being mentally abused by his principal and faculty members. He purportedly left a suicide note in which he apologized to his parents and elder brothers and urged serious action against those who had harassed him. The boy allegedly died by suicide in Telangana, with his family accusing the college management and certain members of the teaching staff of harassment and holding them responsible for his death, police reported. The student, in his first year of intermediate studies at a private college in Narsingi, Telangana, was found hanging in a classroom by his friends on Tuesday night, April 30.

All these incidents reflect one painful similarity: before taking their own lives, the victims tried to express what they were going through and, in the end, wrote in their suicide notes. Instead of receiving empathy and support from those around them when they spoke up about harassment in educational institutions, their voices were often ignored. Their stories must be heard, and their grievances must be addressed before blaming the victim. Continued ignorance will only lead to more such tragedies unless educational institutions actively work towards providing safe, empathetic, and responsive environments for students.",jyoti sharma second year student sharda university greater noida pursuing bd died suicide hostel room passed away july 18 friday reportedly writing suicide note note accuses two professor university administration mental harassment two staff member mahinder shairy arrested far suicide letter wrote mentally harassed humiliated long time caused significant distress expressed desire accused face legal action held teacher pcp dental material responsible death note read “they mentally harassed humiliated stress long time want face thing sorry can’t live like anymore can’t…” shortly incident came light student gathered protested university administration alleging negligence claimed jyoti immense stress due accusation forging signature minor scuffle broke protester police family deceased seen manhandling head dentistry department incident occurred friday night case filed knowledge park police station gautam buddha nagar “the woman’s body sent post mortem two staff member university arrested basis complaint filed victim’s family ” said additional dcp greater noida sudhir kumar added tension escalated due anger among deceased’s family university student towards administration anger scuffle defused police dialogue peace restored scene legal proceeding underway dr ajit kumar university’s public relation officer confirmed two faculty member suspended “for two teacher suspended committee also formed investigate matter action taken found guilty based committee’s report ” stated isolated case student taking life due harassment similar incident took place odisha’s balasore shocking self immolation case july 12 20 year old girl set fire allegedly enduring sexual harassment head college department suffered 90 percent burn later succumbed injury aiims bhubaneswar july 14 brutal incident show discrimination based gender age evident tragic case teenager global public school kerala ended life reportedly bullied assaulted harassed schoolmate according teenager’s mother january 15 forcibly taken toilet made lick seat head pushed toilet flushed also bullied skin tone relentless harassment severely affected mental health ultimately driving end life jumping 26th floor apartment building april 30 2023 16 year old boy died suicide allegedly mentally abused principal faculty member purportedly left suicide note apologized parent elder brother urged serious action harassed boy allegedly died suicide telangana family accusing college management certain member teaching staff harassment holding responsible death police reported student first year intermediate study private college narsingi telangana found hanging classroom friend tuesday night april 30 incident reflect one painful similarity taking life victim tried express going end wrote suicide note instead receiving empathy support around spoke harassment educational institution voice often ignored story must heard grievance must addressed blaming victim continued ignorance lead tragedy unless educational institution actively work towards providing safe empathetic responsive environment student

On that day, the Bangladesh Army – an institution that once held global respect for its role in UN peacekeeping missions – committed crimes against humanity in the Gopalganj district.

Under the pretext of “maintaining law and order,” the military gunned down unarmed civilians and unleashed unspeakable brutality in the heart of Sheikh Hasina’s hometown.

According to multiple reports, including alarming disclosures submitted to the United Nations by the International Crimes Research Foundation (ICRF), the atrocities carried out in Gopalganj may amount to genocide.

The ICRF, in a formal letter to the UN Ethics Office, highlighted not just the Gopalganj bloodbath but a disturbing pattern of political violence, heritage destruction, and gross human rights violations engulfing Bangladesh.

Dubious claims made by the Bangladesh Army vs ground reality

In a desperate attempt at damage control, the Bangladesh Army issued a statement alleging it was forced to use lethal weapons “in self-defense”.

However, this narrative is being artificially amplified through state-controlled media and propaganda loyalists of the Yunus regime, many of whom are embedded in foreign media circles due to past affiliations with outlets like AFP.

On the ground, however, the truth is far darker. Social media is flooded with testimonies and footage showing no resistance from the civilians. Instead, reports suggest nighttime raids are continuing, with families – men, women, and even children – being abducted under the cover of darkness.

The most chilling detail? None of the victims received an autopsy. The four confirmed dead – Dipto Saha (30), Ramzan Kazi (17), Sohel Rana (35), and Imon Talukder – were either cremated or buried hastily, within hours, without inquest or forensic examination. This was not just a cover-up; it was a state-sponsored execution meant to erase evidence.

The Islamist regime of Muhammad Yunus

This atrocity was not an isolated event. It is part of a larger, calculated strategy orchestrated by radical Islamists and jihadists who seized power through what many now call the Jihadist Coup of 2024, orchestrated with the direct patronage of Nobel laureate-turned-Islamist-political-aspirant Muhammad Yunus.

Under this new regime, attacks against Bangladesh’s Hindu community have sharply intensified. Temples are being torched, houses razed, and even the names of districts with Hindu heritage are being targeted for erasure. The Gopalganj district – home to a large Hindu population – has long been in the crosshairs of Islamists.

In 2014, Khaleda Zia, chairperson of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), called for changing its name and made offensive remarks against its residents, labeling them “Gopali” – a derogatory slur.

Today, that same hatred has morphed into violence. Islamist mobs now brazenly wave the flags of Al Qaeda, ISIS, Hamas, and the Taliban, chanting militant slogans in broad daylight. One extremist leader, Mufti Faizul Karim of Islami Shashontontro Andolan, openly vowed to turn Bangladesh into the “next Afghanistan”.

Bangladesh is becoming a new staging ground for international jihadists. According to an article published in the Gatestone Institute website, since the coup, senior leaders from Hamas, Al-Qaeda, and the Taliban have visited Bangladesh. Among them: Sheikh Khaled Quddumi and Khaled Mishal of Hamas, and Pakistani Islamists like Mufti Taqi Usmani and Maulana Fazlur Rahman.

Intelligence sources suggest these visits aimed to forge operational links with Rohingya refugees and “Stranded Pakistanis” (Biharis) – marginalized groups now being radicalized and recruited for terrorist activities targeting Israel, India, the US, and even Gulf nations like Saudi Arabia and Bahrain.

Erasing the pluralistic identity of Bangladesh, one act at a time

The Islamists’ mission goes beyond physical violence – they seek to obliterate Bangladesh’s secular and pluralistic identity. Calls have intensified to remove Bangladesh’s national anthem written by Rabindranath Tagore, branding it a “Hindu song”. There is also growing pressure to rename Gopalganj, as Islamists argue its Hindu-rooted name “offends Muslim sentiment”.

Such demands are not based on faith – they are born of fascist ideology. The historical truth is that Gopalganj was developed by Hindu zamindars and carries the legacy of Rani Rasmoni, a revered Bengali icon. The area has long stood as a symbol of communal harmony and inclusive identity.

But the current regime wants to destroy that. In a blatant act of cultural cleansing, the ancestral home of Satyajit Ray – a global icon of Bengali art and cinema – was demolished in Mymensingh district. Authorities dismissed the home’s connection to Ray’s family despite decades of history and public sentiment. This was not an accident; it was a calculated erasure of Bengali and Hindu legacy.

Other revered landmarks, including those linked to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and Rabindranath Tagore, have also been targeted. And while the physical destruction is horrifying, the psychological warfare being waged is even more insidious.

The Gopalganj massacre is not merely a tragedy – it is a harbinger. The bloodshed claimed at least five lives, denied even the dignity of proper autopsies, and was followed by a military lockdown and media blackouts.

Conclusion

Historically, Gopalganj stood as a bastion of communal peace – even Jamaat-e-Islami and BNP held peaceful rallies there. But under the guise of a National Citizen Party (NCP) rally, violence was engineered. The army did not maintain peace – they incited bloodshed. The curfew that followed wasn’t about safety – it was about sealing off truth, isolating the district, and silencing its people.

By turning a rally into a battlefield, the Yunus regime has made it clear: no place is safe for Bangladesh’s minorities.

The ongoing attacks on cinema halls, Sufi shrines, Hindu temples, and cultural institutions signal a regime hell-bent on rewriting the country’s very DNA. This is not mere negligence – it is a systemic and orchestrated assault on Bangladesh’s soul.

Where once stood a secular nation, inspired by the dreams of its founder Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, now stands a fractured state gripped by fanaticism, manipulated by extremists, and betrayed by its own institutions.

The July 16 massacre in Gopalganj is a war crime. It is a gruesome symbol of a broader genocidal campaign unfolding in Bangladesh under the guise of “restoring order”. The international community must not remain silent. As the UN and Western powers turn a blind eye – complicit in the very coup that empowered these jihadist elements – the people of Bangladesh face annihilation of their culture, heritage, and very existence. If Gopalganj is allowed to be forgotten, tomorrow it will be Faridpur, Narayanganj, Brahmanbaria and beyond. The world must speak up. Not later – now. For every minute of silence, another life is lost, another truth is buried, and another piece of Bangladesh dies.",16th july 2025 must forever marked ‘black day’ history bangladesh day bangladesh army

They also filmed the heinous crime and intimidated the victim into silence. All the accused are leaders of Chhatra Dal and Jubo Dal, the student wing and youth wing of BNP, respectively.

Out of fear and social stigma, the minor Hindu girl did not reveal the ordeal suffered by her to the family members.

The teenager soon became depressed and attempted to commit suicide on 12th July this year. She drank poison but was saved due to immediate medical intervention at the Khagrachhari Sadar Hospital.

On regaining consciousness, the victim narrated the truth to her family members. On the night of 16th July, the girl’s father filed a complaint against the 6 BNP leaders at the Khagrachhari Sadar Police Station.

On Thursday (17th July), the police conducted a raid and arrested 4 of the accused – Arman Hossain, Emon Hossain, Enayet Hossain, and Saddam Hossain. The development was confirmed by SP (Khagrachhari) Arofin Jewel.

BNP leader Fazor Ali rapes Hindu woman at knifepoint in Cumilla

Earlier on 26th June, a prominent leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) named Fazor Ali forcibly broke into the house of a Hindu woman and then raped her at knifepoint.

The incident occurred in Ramchandrapur Panchkitta village in Muradnagar upazila in the Cumilla district of the country. According to reports, the victim is 21 years old and the mother of 2 children. Her husband works and lives in Dubai.

The victim had been residing in her paternal house for about 2 weeks. Fazor Ali had been stalking her from the time she had been staying there.

On 26th June, when the family members of the victim went to a local fair, the BNP leader seized the opportunity to break into his house and rape her at knifepoint.

When the victim screamed for help, locals rushed to the crime scene and detained Fazor Ali. But he managed to flee.

The victim was taken to the Cumilla Medical College Hospital for medical examination. A disturbing video of the incident has now gone viral on social media. The victim filed a complaint with the Muradnagar police on Friday (27th June).

A case was registered under the Women and Children Repression Prevention Act of 2000. The police first arrested 4 people for sharing the explicit video of the victim on social media.

On 29th June, the cops apprehended Fazor Ali and 4 other accused in connection with the rape of the 21-year-old Hindu woman.",minor hindu girl belonging tribal community gang raped 6 member bangladesh nationalist party bnp 27th june year incident occurred khagrachhari chittagong division bangladesh according report victim student 8th std fateful day attended rath yatra fair stayed relative’s place six men identified arman hossain emon hossain enayet hossain saddam hossain md sohel islam md munir islam forcibly entered house gang raped victim chittagong hill khagrachhari 6 settler muslim men gang raped 13 year old girl tripura community hindu girl critical condition hospital 1 2 pic twitter com ogsvx2ieiv — joy da 🇧🇩 joydas1844417 july 17 2025 also filmed heinous crime intimidated victim silence accused leader chhatra dal jubo dal student wing youth wing bnp respectively fear social stigma minor hindu girl reveal ordeal suffered family member teenager soon became depressed attempted commit suicide 12th july year drank poison saved due immediate medical intervention khagrachhari sadar hospital khagrachhari bangladesh turmoil gang rape 8th grade student army accused forcing classmate form human chain news reported newspaper shame noble laureate yunus centre chiefadvisergob… pic twitter com ggxewghctp — saifur rahman saifurmishu july 17 2025 speaking matter resident doctor hospital ripol bappi chakma stated “the student’s condition serious mentally disturbed given necessary treatment ” regaining consciousness victim narrated truth family member night 16th july girl’s father filed complaint 6 bnp leader khagrachhari sadar police station thursday 17th july police conducted raid arrested 4 accused – arman hossain emon hossain enayet hossain saddam hossain development confirmed sp khagrachhari arofin jewel bnp leader fazor ali rape hindu woman knifepoint cumilla earlier 26th june prominent leader bangladesh nationalist party bnp named fazor ali forcibly broke house hindu woman raped knifepoint incident occurred ramchandrapur panchkitta village muradnagar upazila cumilla district country according report victim 21 year old mother 2 child husband work life dubai victim residing paternal house 2 week fazor ali stalking time staying 26th june family member victim went local fair bnp leader seized opportunity break house rape knifepoint victim screamed help local rushed crime scene detained fazor ali managed flee victim taken cumilla medical college hospital medical examination disturbing video incident gone viral social medium victim filed complaint muradnagar police friday 27th june case registered woman child repression prevention act 2000 police first arrested 4 people sharing explicit video victim social medium 29th june cop apprehended fazor ali 4 accused connection rape 21 year old hindu woman

What initially appeared to be a lone voice of protest against sexual harassment has now snowballed into a national scandal, one where justice was crushed under a coordinated campaign of vilification, aided and abetted by those who today shed crocodile tears, and which finally resulted in the death of the 20-year-old victim.

However, merely three days after her death, a shocking detail has emerged: 71 of her 100 classmates, including 41 women, signed a letter attacking her character and defending the very professor she had accused of sexually harassing her, a report published by the Hindustan Times said.

The letter, written in Odia and dated July 1, a day after her formal complaint openly demanded that the victim and her supporters be expelled unless they provided “video evidence” of the harassment suffered by her. The letter also accused the victim of weaponising a sexual harassment charge and targeting the professor after she was barred from writing an internal exam, allegedly due to low attendance.

The backlash, say her family and friends, was orchestrated with chilling precision. “It wasn’t just about disbelief — they ganged up against her,” her brother told reporters. “They assassinated her character both offline and online. She had no one left to turn to.”

Her roommate revealed that the night before she immolated herself, the victim was sleepless, distraught, and deeply shaken by the slander circulating on social media — much of it allegedly spread by student leaders affiliated with the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) and the Congress’s student wing, NSUI. “The same people who called her names online are now marching with placards demanding justice. What justice? You murdered her dignity first,” the roommate said bitterly.

The events of July 12, the day she set herself ablaze, are now under intense scrutiny. Her close friend recounted that she had gone for a quick lunch, only to return and find her engulfed in flames. The friend suspects that a confrontation with the college principal, Dilip Kumar Ghosh, might have pushed her over the edge. “She was already on the edge. Whatever he said in that final meeting must have broken her spirit completely,” she said.

According to the FIR lodged by the victim’s cousin, Ghosh forced her to withdraw her complaint and apologise to her alleged tormentor, Samir Sahoo, just minutes before the incident. Both Ghosh and Sahoo have been booked under multiple sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, including abetment to suicide, sexual harassment, stalking, and criminal intimidation. Police sources suggest that even more stringent charges may be added following the investigation by the Crime Against Women (CAW) unit of the Odisha CID.

The CAW team is not only probing the professor’s history of misconduct, but also investigating how he managed to marshal 71 students to file a counter-allegation, a move that now appears to be an organised smear campaign. The team is also examining the role of the principal in suppressing the complaint and failing to report the matter to higher education authorities.

What makes this tragedy even more grotesque is the rank hypocrisy now on display by the same political outfits whose student bodies vilified her. Both the Congress and the BJD have issued statements demanding action and reforms, even as screenshots of vile social media posts and smear campaigns allegedly run by their own student leaders continue to surface.

On July 12, an FIR was lodged at Sahadevkhunta police station by the cousin of the deceased B.Ed student, painting a damning picture of abuse and institutional betrayal. According to the FIR, Samir Kumar Sahoo, the head of the department of teacher education at Fakir Mohan (Autonomous) College, had repeatedly demanded sexual favours from the student. When she refused to comply, he allegedly began harassing her—failing her in exams, marking her absent unfairly, and subjecting her to mental torment. The FIR further accuses college principal Dilip Kumar Ghosh of coercing the victim into withdrawing her complaint against Sahoo. In a particularly chilling detail, the FIR alleges that just before the suicide attempt, the principal summoned her to his office, compelled her to apologise to Sahoo, and pressured her to drop the charges.

Following preliminary investigations, both Sahoo and Ghosh have been booked under multiple provisions of the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita. These include Section 108 (abetment to suicide, punishable by up to 10 years in prison), Section 75(1)(ii) (sexual harassment involving a demand for sexual favours), Section 78 (stalking), Section 79 (eve-teasing), Section 351(2) (criminal intimidation), and Section 3(5) (common intention). Authorities have indicated that more serious charges could be added as the probe deepens.

In response to mounting national outrage, the Odisha government has swung into damage control, mandating awareness workshops on sexual harassment laws and ordering all universities and colleges to prominently display women’s helpline numbers. The University Grants Commission (UGC) has sent a four-member fact-finding team to the college, led by Professor Raj Kumar Mittal, to assess regulatory compliance and institutional failures. A parallel probe by the state’s Higher Education Department is also underway.

But for the victim and her grieving family, these actions come far too late. “This is not just suicide. This is a slow public execution carried out by an entire system,” said a friend who stood by her till the end.",heartrending suicide 20 year old b ed student fakir mohan autonomous college balasore swiftly devolving grim indictment institutional rot political hypocrisy cruelty peer betrayal initially appeared lone voice protest sexual harassment snowballed national scandal one justice crushed coordinated campaign vilification aided abetted today shed crocodile tear finally resulted death 20 year old victim however merely three day death shocking detail emerged 71 100 classmate including 41 woman signed letter attacking character defending professor accused sexually harassing report published hindustan time said letter written odia dated july 1 day formal complaint openly demanded victim supporter expelled unless provided “video evidence” harassment suffered letter also accused victim weaponising sexual harassment charge targeting professor barred writing internal exam allegedly due low attendance backlash say family friend orchestrated chilling precision “it wasn’t disbelief — ganged ” brother told reporter “they assassinated character offline online one left turn ” roommate revealed night immolated victim sleepless distraught deeply shaken slander circulating social medium — much allegedly spread student leader affiliated biju janata dal bjd congress’s student wing nsui “the people called name online marching placard demanding justice justice murdered dignity first ” roommate said bitterly event july 12 day set ablaze intense scrutiny close friend recounted gone quick lunch return find engulfed flame friend suspect confrontation college principal dilip kumar ghosh might pushed edge “she already edge whatever said final meeting must broken spirit completely ” said according fir lodged victim’s cousin ghosh forced withdraw complaint apologise alleged tormentor samir sahoo minute incident ghosh sahoo booked multiple section bharatiya nyaya sanhita including abetment suicide sexual harassment stalking criminal intimidation police source suggest even stringent charge may added following investigation crime woman caw unit odisha cid caw team probing professor’s history misconduct also investigating managed marshal 71 student file counter allegation move appears organised smear campaign team also examining role principal suppressing complaint failing report matter higher education authority make tragedy even grotesque rank hypocrisy display political outfit whose student body vilified congress bjd issued statement demanding action reform even screenshots vile social medium post smear campaign allegedly run student leader continue surface july 12 fir lodged sahadevkhunta police station cousin deceased b ed student painting damning picture abuse institutional betrayal according fir samir kumar sahoo head department teacher education fakir mohan autonomous college repeatedly demanded sexual favour student refused comply allegedly began harassing her—failing exam marking absent unfairly subjecting mental torment fir accuses college principal dilip kumar ghosh coercing victim withdrawing complaint sahoo particularly chilling detail fir alleges suicide attempt principal summoned office compelled apologise sahoo pressured drop charge following preliminary investigation sahoo ghosh booked multiple provision bharatiya nyay sanhita include section 108 abetment suicide punishable 10 year prison section 75 1 ii sexual harassment involving demand sexual favour section 78 stalking section 79 eve teasing section 351 2 criminal intimidation section 3 5 common intention authority indicated serious charge could added probe deepens response mounting national outrage odisha government swung damage control mandating awareness workshop sexual harassment law ordering university college prominently display women’s helpline number university grant commission ugc sent four member fact finding team college led professor raj kumar mittal assess regulatory compliance institutional failure parallel probe state’s higher education department also underway victim grieving family action come far late “this suicide slow public execution carried entire system ” said friend stood till end

The book titled “Exploring Society: India and Beyond” introduces students to some important events and episodes in Indian history, including the Delhi Sultanate, the Mughal rule, the Maratha empire and the colonial period. The book has recently become the cause of a huge liberal meltdown.

The book has a chapter titled “Reshaping India’s Political Map”, which covers Indian history between the 13th and the 17th century, including the rise and fall of the Delhi Sultanate and the resistance to it, the Vijayanagar Empire, the Mughal Empire, and the resistance faced by them, and the rise of the Sikhs.

At the beginning of the book comes is a note for students, which gives them a contextual understanding of the inclusion of some dark historical episodes like the Islamic fundamentalism in the book and the approach to be adopted while studying them. “History sometimes seems to be full of wars and destruction… Should we omit them entirely? … The best approach is to face them and analyse them so as to understand what made such developments possible and, hopefully, help avoid their recurrence in future. It is important to study those darker developments dispassionately, without blaming anyone living today for them… The past continues to live with us and shapes the present.”

To be introduced in schools from the 2025-26 academic year, the book attempts to provide a complete picture of historical events or periods included in it by retaining their negative as well as positive aspects. While the book mentions how Mughal rulers Jahangir and Shah Jahan patronised art and architecture, it also highlights the brutalities of Babur, who massacred the entire populations of cities. It describes Aurangzeb as a military ruler who banned un-Islamic practices and reimposed taxes on non-Muslims and defines the rule of Mughal ruler Akbar, the left-liberal coterie’s poster boy of the Mughal period, as a “blend of brutality and tolerance”.

But the left liberals, who are habitual of using history as a tool to further their agenda, have a problem with it. They have a problem because the facade built by leftist historians who downplayed and whitewashed the brutalities of Islamic invaders and justified their atrocities against Hindus is crumbling. For a long time, they pushed a false narrative by portraying Mughal King Akbar as the epitome of religious tolerance. They eulogised him for abolishing the Jizya tax, a religious tax levied by Muslim rulers on Hindus and other non-Muslims for merely existing in an Islamic regime, but cleverly omitted to mention how he waged Jihad against Hindus during the seige of Chittorgarh and ordered the massacre of 30,000 Hindus populace.

The seige of Chittoragarh

By 1567, Mughal ruler Akbar had managed to get most parts of northern India under his control. Now, he was eyeing the Kingdom of Mewar, which was being ruled by the Suryavanshi Sisodia Rajput dynasty at that time, under Rana Udai Singh II. The Mewar kingdom stood as a symbol of resistance against the Mughal Empire, which had subdued most of the surrounding kingdoms. Akbar decided to launch a military expedition to besiege the Mewar capital at Chittorgarh and termed it as ‘Jihad’ against the infidels (Hindus).

Chittorgarh, situated in present-day Rajasthan, was a formidable fort spanning across 700 acres, situated atop 180 a high hill in the heart of the Mewar Kingdom. The fortress had survived the sieges by Aluddin Khilji (1303) and Bahadur Shah of Gujarat (1535).

Refusing to bow down before the Mughal emperor, Rana Udai Singh II geared up to defend his kingdom. In October 1567, Akbar marched from Agra with his army of 40,000 men equipped with cannons, muskets and siege equipment, aiming to bring the Mewar Kingdom to its knees. Inside the Chittorgarh fort was an army of 8000 Rajput warriors prepared to defend their pride. On the advice of his counsels, Rana Udai Singh II moved to his principality in the Aravali hills and left the Rajput army under the command of Jaimal Rathore.

The Mughal army strategically set up their camp at the base of the Chittorgarh hill to cut off supplies to the fort. The siege began, and both armies soon engaged in a full-fledged battle with arrows, musket shots and cannon shots flying across the sky. The Mughal army was struggling to penetrate the 30-feet-thick walls of the Chittorgarh fort. The Mughal soldiers made several strategies to breach the mighty walls of the Chittorgarh fort. They tried to stealthily march towards the base of the fort through covered trenches and dig burrows under the foundation of the fort and pack gunpowder in them to blow up the fort’s base. However, the Rajput armies were watching them. They dug counter-mines and resisted the Mughal armies, which suffered heavy losses.

The battle went on for months, till the fateful day when the Rajput commander Jaimal Rathore fell. There are varied accounts of the cause of Jaimal Rathore’s death. Some accounts say that he died from a musket shot fired by Akbar on February 22, 1568. Other accounts mention that Rathore was killed by Mughal marksmen. Jaimal Rathore’s death was a turning point in the battle, as the Rajput armies were demoralised and the Mughal armies were able to breach the fort. As soon as the fort was breached by the Mughal armies, the Rajput women inside the fort performed jauhar to protect their honour from the enemy. The remaining Rajput soldiers put up a final resistance before the Mughal armies and laid down their lives, before the fort was finally captured on February 23-24, 1568.

Some Mughal sources say that the Rajput armies of about 8000-10,000 men were entirely killed. Mughal king Akbar, who was frustrated and enraged by the stiff resistance put up by the Rajput armies, proclaimed the siege of Chittorgarh and the victory of Islam over infidels and ordered the massacre of the entire civilian population of around 30,000 people. The men were killed, and several women and children were enslaved.

But, according to left-liberals, Mughal King Akbar was a liberal and tolerant ruler, who abolished the Jizya tax, and not a cruel, intolerant tyrant who ordered the slaughter of thousands of innocent, unarmed Hindu civilians of the Chittorgarh fort, who posed no harm to him. This special ability to see one truth by ignoring the other truth is peculiar to the left-liberals. The only acceptable truth to them is their version of truth, no matter how incomplete, selective or even untrue it is.

This unique quality of theirs begs the question, Jo cheez jaisi hai usey vaisa usey vaisa he pesh kyo na kiya jaye, taat ko resham kyo kaha jaye?

The development comes after the newspaper published an articlefor their latest article implicating him in the life of convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, saying it is false and politically damaging.

The suit was filed in a Miami federal court on Friday (18th July) a day after Trump openly threatened litigation. The WSJ released a bombshell report on Thursday (17th July), which said that Trump wrote a birthday letter to Epstein in 2003 with a hand-drawn portrait of a naked woman and alluded to a “secret” that the two men shared. The article suggested a common interest between Trump and Epstein, the deceased financier who had been accused of using underage girls for sex.

Outraged by the article, Trump attacked the newspaper on his social media platform Truth Social, labeling the report a “scam” and the letter “fake.” Trump accused WSJ’s editor Emma Tucker of purposefully releasing false content and threatened to “sue the ass off” Murdoch and the publication. The lawsuit claims at least $10 billion in damages, claiming reputational damage and political consequences.

I never wrote a picture in my life. I don’t draw pictures of women,” Trump said in his internet posting, denying he wrote the letter. But some media immediately added that Trump had previously drawn sketches for fund-raising events.

Epstein files: A political headache for Trump administration

This suit is merely one aspect of the larger Epstein scandal that still shadows Trump’s second term in the White House. The Epstein files, sealed investigative reports on Jeffrey Epstein’s purported wrongdoings have been of public interest for many years, particularly among Trump’s “Make America Great Again” base who have called for full disclosure.

When Trump came back to the White House in January 2025, he and Attorney General Pam Bondi vowed transparency and indicated that they would release all of Epstein’s materials, including what many thought was a “client list” of influential individuals who were part of Epstein’s trafficking ring.

But that vow seems to have disintegrated. Earlier in the month, the Justice Department made public a memo saying there was no such list of clients and no proof of blackmail of well-known people. The memo was unsigned and merely declared that the case was closed, an action that incensed many conservatives expecting some form of accountability.

Tucker Carlson, a former stalwart Trump supporter, expressed disillusionment at a student summit on 11th July, stating, “The government I voted for told me to shut up and stop asking questions.” Conservative activist Charlie Kirk reiterated the disillusionment, sharing that when he asked a group of 7,000 people if the Epstein case was still relevant, all hands went up.

The pushback was so harsh that Trump had no choice but to react. On 12th July, he instructed his supporters not to “waste time and energy” on the Epstein documents, which led some pundits, such as Dinesh D’Souza, to shift their tone and tell their supporters to move on. But the flip only created more speculations: Was Trump attempting to cover something up? Was his name on the very list he had previously vowed to publish?

Asked by journalists whether Attorney General Bondi had read his name in the Epstein documents, Trump simply replied “no” and blamed the controversy on a conspiracy by former officials like James Comey and Barack Obama, a claim with no clear basis.

What are the Epstein files?

“Epstein files” consist of investigative files, records, videos, and contacts collated by federal agencies while investigating Epstein’s criminal enterprise. They are said to contain flight logs from Epstein’s private aircraft, contact lists, accounting records, and even video evidence of abuse.

Attorney General Pam Bondi released the initial batch of redacted documents in February 2025, including flight records and contact lists. She asserted that more would be released after review to shield victims’ identities. Bondi even stated that one time a client list was “sitting on my desk” to be reviewed.

But by July, the memo of the Justice Department made a stark U-turn. It asserted there was no incriminating client list and no reliable proof of blackmail, an explicit contradiction of what had been intimated before by Bondi and Trump himself. The memo asserted the case was closed and that the public should not anticipate further revelations.

That gesture has fueled public distrust. Some now think Trump’s previous friendship with Epstein, they were spotted together at social gatherings in the 1990s and early 2000s and Trump was listed on Epstein’s flight logs at least seven times is the reason the administration suddenly closed the files.

Lawyer of Epstein prior to his death, David Schoen, confirmed that Trump had denied any incriminating evidence against him. However, with the lack of transparency, speculations are increasing.",u president donald trump sued medium magnate rupert murdoch wall street journal wsj defamation development come newspaper published articlefor latest article implicating life convicted pedophile jeffrey epstein saying false politically damaging suit filed miami federal court friday 18th july day trump openly threatened litigation wsj released bombshell report thursday 17th july said trump wrote birthday letter epstein 2003 hand drawn portrait naked woman alluded “secret” two men shared article suggested common interest trump epstein deceased financier accused using underage girl sex outraged article trump attacked newspaper social medium platform truth social labeling report “scam” letter “fake ” trump accused wsj’s editor emma tucker purposefully releasing false content threatened “sue as off” murdoch publication lawsuit claim least 10 billion damage claiming reputational damage political consequence never wrote picture life don’t draw picture woman ” trump said internet posting denying wrote letter medium immediately added trump previously drawn sketch fund raising event epstein file political headache trump administration suit merely one aspect larger epstein scandal still shadow trump’s second term white house epstein file sealed investigative report jeffrey epstein’s purported wrongdoing public interest many year particularly among trump’s “make america great again” base called full disclosure trump came back white house january 2025 attorney general pam bondi vowed transparency indicated would release epstein’s material including many thought “client list” influential individual part epstein’s trafficking ring vow seems disintegrated earlier month justice department made public memo saying list client proof blackmail well known people memo unsigned merely declared case closed action incensed many conservative expecting form accountability tucker carlson former stalwart trump supporter expressed disillusionment student summit 11th july stating “the government voted told shut stop asking question ” conservative activist charlie kirk reiterated disillusionment sharing asked group 7 000 people epstein case still relevant hand went pushback harsh trump choice react 12th july instructed supporter “waste time energy” epstein document led pundit dinesh d’souza shift tone tell supporter move flip created speculation trump attempting cover something name list previously vowed publish asked journalist whether attorney general bondi read name epstein document trump simply replied “no” blamed controversy conspiracy former official like james comey barack obama claim clear basis epstein file “epstein files” consist investigative file record video contact collated federal agency investigating epstein’s criminal enterprise said contain flight log epstein’s private aircraft contact list accounting record even video evidence abuse attorney general pam bondi released initial batch redacted document february 2025 including flight record contact list asserted would released review shield victims’ identity bondi even stated one time client list “sitting desk” reviewed july memo justice department made stark u turn asserted incriminating client list reliable proof blackmail explicit contradiction intimated bondi trump memo asserted case closed public anticipate revelation gesture fueled public distrust think trump’s previous friendship epstein spotted together social gathering 1990s early 2000s trump listed epstein’s flight log least seven time reason administration suddenly closed file lawyer epstein prior death david schoen confirmed trump denied incriminating evidence however lack transparency speculation increasing
OpIndia,19/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/druze-buffer-zones-israel-syria-strikes-west-asia-faultlines/,"Protecting Druze, furthering its strategic interests, maintaining buffer zones: Understanding why Israel decided to launch strikes inside Syria","West Asia is once again on the edge. What began as a local conflict in southern Syria’s Suwayda province between two communities—the Druze and the Bedouin—has escalated into a regional flashpoint. Israeli fighter jets have conducted over 160 airstrikes inside Syrian territory.

The trigger for this attack was brutal crackdown by the new Syrian government against the Druze minority, a group with deep historical and cultural ties to Israel. In response to the violence and mass executions of Druze civilians— videos of some of which have surfaced on social media—Israel Defence Forces started striking Syria, marking a sudden direct action not just for self-defence, but also humanitarian rescue.

However, this was not just about saving Druze but also about inflicting damage to the Syrian military and maintaining buffer zones between Israel and Syria. Israel has accepted an ex-Jihadist as a Syrian President for Geopolitical reasons, but through this attack, Israel made it clear that it will not accept religious and ethnic violence by the government in Syria.

Who are the Druze and why Israel cares

To understand Israel’s military response, we must first understand the Druze people.

The Druze are a small, tightly-knit religious community that emerged in the 10th century from Ismaili Shia Islam but have evolved into a distinct ethno-religious group. They live mainly in the mountainous regions of Syria, Lebanon, and Israel. In Israel, the Druze community is unique—they serve in the IDF (Israeli Defence Forces), participate in civil society, and are considered loyal citizens of the Jewish state. Their identity is intertwined with Israel’s own security fabric.

In southern Syria, particularly Suwayda, the Druze live close to Israel’s Golan Heights. This area has long served as a buffer between Israel and various jihadist groups operating during the Syrian civil war. For Israel, instability in this Druze-dominated region represents not just a humanitarian crisis but also a strategic nightmare. The possibility of another hostile front opening up—this time with Bedouin, which is unacceptable.

The latest round of violence started when a Bedouin tribe set up a checkpoint in Suwayda and reportedly attacked a Druze man. This led to a cycle of retaliations—kidnappings, executions, and tit-for-tat violence. The Syrian regime intervened, not as a neutral party, but in favour of the Bedouins. Local reports confirm that Syrian forces sided with the Bedouins, escalating the violence and leading to over 300 deaths in just a few days, including 27 Druze civilians reportedly executed in cold blood.

Israel issued several warnings to Damascus, urging it to stop targeting the Druze. These were ignored. When visual evidence of mass killings began to circulate, and Druze volunteers inside Israel started crossing the border to protect their brothers, the IDF stepped in. However, Israel’s strike was not limited to militias—it targeted the Syrian Ministry of Defence and army convoys, directly challenging the Al-Shara government’s role in the violence.

President Al-Shara fails Syrians

Al-Shara, the current president of Syria and an ex-Jihadist, had a wonderful chance to establish himself as the leader of Syria. Bring peace, prosperity, business and investment to the long-sanctioned Syrian society. Regional players like Saudi Arabia, Turkey and even to an extent Israel, with global players like the US, are positive towards him for different reasons.

He should understand the scenario and should protect Syrians rather than injecting violence into society. However, the attacks on the Druze minority tells a different story. After multiple warnings from Israel, Al-Shara did not act against the violence rather his forces supported it. This triggered the response from Israel.

America steps in—But it’s not that simple

The US has now stepped in, calling for restraint. However, its position is complicated. Syria is not part of the American camp. However, in recent years, under request from Turkey and Saudi Arabia, even Washington has engaged with Al-Shara when Trump was on a visit to West Asia. Both nations had their own reasons. Turkey wants to reduce refugee inflows. Saudi Arabia seeks to bring Syria into a broader Sunni axis.

That does not mean Syria is now an ally. Moreover, this is where the “bloc” theory fails. Global alliances today are transactional, not ideological. For example, just because India is talking to China does not mean it has joined the Chinese camp. Similarly, American outreach to Syria does not imply trust—it is tactical, driven by temporary needs.

The bigger picture: Israel’s future borders

Some analysts believe this move also fits into a larger Israeli vision—what some call “Greater Israel.” While this theory is often misused or exaggerated, the current reality is this: Israel wants stable, secure buffer zones around its borders, especially in regions where its own minorities, like the Druze reside.

By protecting the Druze, Israel not only wins the moral high ground but also gains influence over a strategic area of Syria. The goal is not to annex territory, but to ensure that enemies do not control it.

As of now, a ceasefire has reportedly been reached. However, Israel made clear that any further attack on the Druze Community will not be tolerated, even outside its borders and will invite a military response.",west asia edge began local conflict southern syria’s suwayda province two communities—the druze bedouin—has escalated regional flashpoint israeli fighter jet conducted 160 airstrikes inside syrian territory trigger attack brutal crackdown new syrian government druze minority group deep historical cultural tie israel response violence mass execution druze civilians— video surfaced social media—israel defence force started striking syria marking sudden direct action self defence also humanitarian rescue however saving druze also inflicting damage syrian military maintaining buffer zone israel syria israel accepted ex jihadist syrian president geopolitical reason attack israel made clear accept religious ethnic violence government syria druze israel care understand israel’s military response must first understand druze people druze small tightly knit religious community emerged 10th century ismaili shia islam evolved distinct ethno religious group live mainly mountainous region syria lebanon israel israel druze community unique—they serve idf israeli defence force participate civil society considered loyal citizen jewish state identity intertwined israel’s security fabric southern syria particularly suwayda druze live close israel’s golan height area long served buffer israel various jihadist group operating syrian civil war israel instability druze dominated region represents humanitarian crisis also strategic nightmare possibility another hostile front opening up—this time bedouin unacceptable latest round violence started bedouin tribe set checkpoint suwayda reportedly attacked druze man led cycle retaliations—kidnappings execution tit tat violence syrian regime intervened neutral party favour bedouin local report confirm syrian force sided bedouin escalating violence leading 300 death day including 27 druze civilian reportedly executed cold blood israel issued several warning damascus urging stop targeting druze ignored visual evidence mass killing began circulate druze volunteer inside israel started crossing border protect brother idf stepped however israel’s strike limited militias—it targeted syrian ministry defence army convoy directly challenging al shara government’s role violence president al shara fails syrian al shara current president syria ex jihadist wonderful chance establish leader syria bring peace prosperity business investment long sanctioned syrian society regional player like saudi arabia turkey even extent israel global player like u positive towards different reason understand scenario protect syrian rather injecting violence society however attack druze minority tell different story multiple warning israel al shara act violence rather force supported triggered response israel america step in—but it’s simple u stepped calling restraint however position complicated syria part american camp however recent year request turkey saudi arabia even washington engaged al shara trump visit west asia nation reason turkey want reduce refugee inflow saudi arabia seek bring syria broader sunni axis mean syria ally moreover “bloc” theory fails global alliance today transactional ideological example india talking china mean joined chinese camp similarly american outreach syria imply trust—it tactical driven temporary need bigger picture israel’s future border analyst believe move also fit larger israeli vision—what call “greater israel ” theory often misused exaggerated current reality israel want stable secure buffer zone around border especially region minority like druze reside protecting druze israel win moral high ground also gain influence strategic area syria goal annex territory ensure enemy control ceasefire reportedly reached however israel made clear attack druze community tolerated even outside border invite military response

Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati, who appeared for the Centre and Delhi police, stated that the Union Ministry of Home Affairs has issued ‘look out notices’ and ‘hue and cry’ notices to all senior police officials across the country to trace the missing Russian woman.

While hearing submissions, a bench led by Justice Surya Kant flagged several issues and directed the authorities to immediately enquire with Railway officials and other means (non-aerial) of public transport to trace any movement of the missing lady and the child.

The bench also directed the Delhi police to check CCTV footage of all entry and exit points in Delhi NCR, in their ongoing probe to find the Russian woman and the child.

“They need to do something very quickly”, Justice Surya Kant stated, flagging concern over the circumstances in which the missing lady may be and the safety of the child.

After issuing directions, the Supreme Court posted the matter for Monday, July 21.

During the hearing, the ASG also informed the Supreme Court that the officials of the Russian embassy have been cooperating in the matter.

The ASG further submitted that the Indian authorities have received a WhatsApp communication from the Russian embassy regarding the missing woman’s July 5 visit to the embassy. The communication stated that she visited the embassy for an hour seeking legal help over complaints that she had against her Indian husband, the ASG said.

The apex court was also informed that the External Affairs Ministry has confirmed that the Russian woman is untraceable even for her family members in Russia.

Notably, the counsel appearing for the Indian husband submitted that the husband’s family and he have been facilitating the authorities with all the information they have to help trace the missing Russian national and the child.

The Supreme Court had on Thursday issued specific directions to the concerned Central Ministries and the Delhi Police to issue look-out notices to trace the Russian woman who has allegedly absconded with her child, who was born out of wedlock with her Indian husband.

The top court had also issued directions to the concerned Indian authorities to seek permission from the Russian Embassy to enter the residential premises of an official of the Russian Embassy who was allegedly seen helping the Russian woman in entering the embassy premises in Delhi through the back door with her heavy luggage.

As per the communication received from the Russian embassy by the Indian government through a WhatsApp text, the missing woman had visited the embassy on July 5 to make complaints against her Indian husband and to seek legal help.

As per the submissions made on behalf of the Centre, the Russian woman who remains missing along with the child had made a transaction from her official bank account last week after which her account balance was reduced from ₹250 to ₹169, hinting that it’s unlikely that she’s fled the country as that would require a higher spending.

She has been untraceable since and has not left the country officially, the ASG stated. However, on being asked by the top court about the woman trying to flee the country through extralegal means, the ASG responded that she may be travelling domestically on foot or through other means (non-aerial) of public transport.

OpIndia,18/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/uk-lower-voting-age-democracy-strengthening-or-not/,UK to lower voting age to 16: A move towards strengthening democracy or a poor decision giving such responsibility to teens who may not...,"On Thursday, 17 July, the United Kingdom made the age of 16 the voting age in all UK elections within two years. It represents a fundamental change in democratic participation. However, this policy ignores evidence of artificial sleepiness about developmental readiness and external effects about the unique weaknesses of adolescents, which leads to the decision to potentially fail.

Neurological immaturity and cognitive limitations

According to modern neuroscience, the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for complex decision making, undergoes development till mid-20s. At the age of 16, adolescents increased sensitivity to emotional impulses and colleague pressure, preferred short-term rewards over long-term consequences, with cognitive functions. This biological reality directly challenges claims of readiness for electoral decisions with decades-long societal impacts. As noted by researchers, 16-year-olds lack the “cold cognition” required for informed political judgments, particularly under stress or external influence. The UK government’s polling reinforces this: Only 18% of 16–17-year-olds expressed definite intent to vote, suggesting limited engagement with democratic responsibility.

Deficits in civic knowledge and life experience

By lowering the voting age, the UK government is ignoring the alarming gaps in civic literacy. Only 20% of 8th graders, who are typically aged between 13 to 14, score “proficient” in civics assessments globally. 31% of them failed to understand the foundational concepts of polity, such as constitutional governance and the rule of law. By the age of 16, these deficits remain the same. A Study conducted in the UK reveals that students have minimal retention of political knowledge outside the class. Apart from that, teachers are also shaping the students’ views based on their ideological biases (mainly left in the UK). The majority of 16-year-olds remain financially dependent on their parents, and most of them study in school. As one critic noted, “Idealism turns to reality as you learn and observe”—a transition incomplete before 18.

Empirical evidence of failed engagement

Supporters of the government are citing the 2024 Scottish independence referendum as a success story. But they are ignoring the contradictory data of the 2021 Welsh parliamentary elections. After being allowed to vote, only 37% of eligible 16–17-year-olds registered to vote. Even in Scotland, initial turnout surges faded rapidly. This aligns with the broader youth voting trends. In the 2019 UK elections, while people over the age of 65 saw 74% voter participation, turnout for 18–24-year-olds was just 47%, which shows that the young population of the UK doesn’t even want to vote in the elections.

‘Half of them don’t even want the blooming vote!’



Labour says votes at 16 will restore trust in democracy, but polling shows many 16-17 year olds don’t want it, and only 18% would definitely vote.

Vulnerability to external influence

In current times, social media trends are shaped by political views. Most teenagers on social media are under the influence of those trends, such as the “Free Palestine movement, Global warming and free migration movement”. Apart from that, institutions like Harvard and Oxford are also shaping their political views (mostly left-leaning). A University of Exeter study found that their votes often mirror household preferences rather than independent analysis. Digital platforms exacerbate this by algorithms pushing polarised content, and peers—not policy platforms—sway decisions. Unlike adults with diverse life experiences, adolescents lack frameworks to critically evaluate manipulative narratives.

Inconsistent legal and social standards

The voting-age reduction creates a contradictory rights landscape. Sixteen-year-olds may vote but cannot:

•⁠ ⁠Legally marry without parental consent (England/Northern Ireland)

•⁠ ⁠Serve in combat roles

•⁠ ⁠Purchase alcohol, cigarettes, or lottery tickets

•⁠ ⁠Stand as electoral candidates

This inconsistency dilutes the “age of majority” principle. As Conservative critics argue, it is incoherent to deem adolescents mature enough to shape national policy yet legally incompetent to enter binding contracts or consume alcohol responsibly. Such disparities undermine the social contract and invite future challenges to age-based rights boundaries.

Conclusion: Preserving electoral integrity

Lowering the voting age prioritises symbolic inclusivity over electoral credibility. Without parallel investments in civics education or evidence that 16-year-olds sustainably engage in this reform, risks cementing transient preferences into law and straining democratic legitimacy. As the Electoral Commission concluded in 2004, 18 remains the international standard because it balances neurological maturity, life experience, and legal autonomy. The UK should heed Wales’ lesson: expanding access without solving engagement failures merely widens the electorate’s least participatory demographic. Until adolescents demonstrate consistent civic competence, the vote must remain an adult responsibility.",thursday 17 july united kingdom made age 16 voting age uk election within two year represents fundamental change democratic participation however policy ignores evidence artificial sleepiness developmental readiness external effect unique weakness adolescent lead decision potentially fail neurological immaturity cognitive limitation according modern neuroscience prefrontal cortex responsible complex decision making undergoes development till mid 20 age 16 adolescent increased sensitivity emotional impulse colleague pressure preferred short term reward long term consequence cognitive function biological reality directly challenge claim readiness electoral decision decade long societal impact noted researcher 16 year old lack “cold cognition” required informed political judgment particularly stress external influence uk government’s polling reinforces 18 16–17 year old expressed definite intent vote suggesting limited engagement democratic responsibility deficit civic knowledge life experience lowering voting age uk government ignoring alarming gap civic literacy 20 8th grader typically aged 13 14 score “proficient” civics assessment globally 31 failed understand foundational concept polity constitutional governance rule law age 16 deficit remain study conducted uk reveals student minimal retention political knowledge outside class apart teacher also shaping students’ view based ideological bias mainly left uk majority 16 year old remain financially dependent parent study school one critic noted “idealism turn reality learn observe”—a transition incomplete 18 empirical evidence failed engagement supporter government citing 2024 scottish independence referendum success story ignoring contradictory data 2021 welsh parliamentary election allowed vote 37 eligible 16–17 year old registered vote even scotland initial turnout surge faded rapidly aligns broader youth voting trend 2019 uk election people age 65 saw 74 voter participation turnout 18–24 year old 47 show young population uk doesn’t even want vote election ‘half don’t even want blooming vote ’ labour say vote 16 restore trust democracy polling show many 16 17 year old don’t want 18 would definitely vote even support party split evenly expected pic twitter com qq4bixma3d — gb news gbnews july 17 2025 vulnerability external influence current time social medium trend shaped political view teenager social medium influence trend “free palestine movement global warming free migration movement” apart institution like harvard oxford also shaping political view mostly left leaning university exeter study found vote often mirror household preference rather independent analysis digital platform exacerbate algorithm pushing polarised content peers—not policy platforms—sway decision unlike adult diverse life experience adolescent lack framework critically evaluate manipulative narrative oxford university student protest influence free palestine movement photo credit sky news inconsistent legal social standard voting age reduction creates contradictory right landscape sixteen year old may vote cannot •⁠ ⁠legally marry without parental consent england northern ireland •⁠ ⁠serve combat role •⁠ ⁠purchase alcohol cigarette lottery ticket •⁠ ⁠stand electoral candidate inconsistency dilutes “age majority” principle conservative critic argue incoherent deem adolescent mature enough shape national policy yet legally incompetent enter binding contract consume alcohol responsibly disparity undermine social contract invite future challenge age based right boundary conclusion preserving electoral integrity lowering voting age prioritises symbolic inclusivity electoral credibility without parallel investment civics education evidence 16 year old sustainably engage reform risk cementing transient preference law straining democratic legitimacy electoral commission concluded 2004 18 remains international standard balance neurological maturity life experience legal autonomy uk heed wales’ lesson expanding access without solving engagement failure merely widens electorate’s least participatory demographic adolescent demonstrate consistent civic competence vote must remain adult responsibility
OpIndia,18/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/rbi-to-roll-out-climate-change-disclosure-rules-for-banks-and-financial-institutions/,"RBI to roll out climate change disclosure rules for banks and financial institutions, recognises climate change as a source of major financial concern: Read...","The Reserve Bank of India is in the process of working out rules for banks and financial institutions for the disclosure and management of risks arising from climate change. The move is aimed at reducing carbon emissions by shifting high-emission investments to low-emission substitutes, to help achieve the country’s climate targets.

According to a report in Reuters, the central bank’s attempt is in line with the global efforts in shifting to low-carbon economies by assessing the amount of money being directed towards carbon-intensive activities as well as green investments. Similar disclosures have already been made compulsory in countries like the UK and Japan. However, the development comes against the backdrop of several global banks, including JP Morgan, Citibank, Morgan Stanley, and HSBC, whittling down their climate commitments after the re-election of Donald Trump as the US President.

Banks to include climate-change related risk in loan portfolios

Since 2022, the RBI has reportedly been working on the rules, which will require banks and financial institutions to make regular disclosures about climate-related risk in their loan portfolios, accompanied by mitigation strategies and targets. Initially, the disclosures are likely to be made voluntarily, effective from fiscal year 2027 and will eventually be made compulsory from the next fiscal year, i.e. 2028.

Under the central bank’s assessment rules for climate change, banks will also have to conduct periodic stress tests, based on the RBI’s soon-to-be-issued guidance note, to assess the impact of extreme weather or climate events such as floods, cyclones, and heat waves on borrowers and the economy. As per the draft rules, banks will also be required to calculate the total emissions of borrowers and disclose this information by asset classes and industries. These disclosures are expected to be included in the financial statements of the borrowers.

Climate change disclosures not expected to impact loan pricing in short term

A 52-page draft note of the RBI, accessed by Reuters, reportedly prescribes a methodology for predicting and analysing the impact of extreme climate events and transition risks on the ability of borrowers to repay loans. The transition risks include those arising from changes in consumer behaviour, policy, and technology as the world gradually shifts to a low-carbon economy. The climate change disclosures are not expected to impact loan pricing in the short term.

As per the report, the RBI earlier recognised climate change as a source of major financial concern. In 2024, the central bank released a draft standard disclosure framework to receive public feedback. Banks have started gearing up for the upcoming assessment rules. Several banks have reportedly started compiling data to meet the standards of the imminent disclosure rules. A few large banks have issued tenders to engage climate consultants to assist them with disclosures.

It is reported that the RBI’s decision to release climate disclosure rules is aligned with India’s aim of diverting the flow of resources to climate-friendly sectors, for which a draft framework was recently released. Ahead of the 2025 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) to be held in Brazil in November, India, which aims to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2070, is preparing to publish a fresh national emissions-reduction target.",reserve bank india process working rule bank financial institution disclosure management risk arising climate change move aimed reducing carbon emission shifting high emission investment low emission substitute help achieve country’s climate target according report reuters central bank’s attempt line global effort shifting low carbon economy assessing amount money directed towards carbon intensive activity well green investment similar disclosure already made compulsory country like uk japan however development come backdrop several global bank including jp morgan citibank morgan stanley hsbc whittling climate commitment election donald trump u president bank include climate change related risk loan portfolio since 2022 rbi reportedly working rule require bank financial institution make regular disclosure climate related risk loan portfolio accompanied mitigation strategy target initially disclosure likely made voluntarily effective fiscal year 2027 eventually made compulsory next fiscal year e 2028 central bank’s assessment rule climate change bank also conduct periodic stress test based rbi’s soon issued guidance note assess impact extreme weather climate event flood cyclone heat wave borrower economy per draft rule bank also required calculate total emission borrower disclose information asset class industry disclosure expected included financial statement borrower climate change disclosure expected impact loan pricing short term 52 page draft note rbi accessed reuters reportedly prescribes methodology predicting analysing impact extreme climate event transition risk ability borrower repay loan transition risk include arising change consumer behaviour policy technology world gradually shift low carbon economy climate change disclosure expected impact loan pricing short term per report rbi earlier recognised climate change source major financial concern 2024 central bank released draft standard disclosure framework receive public feedback bank started gearing upcoming assessment rule several bank reportedly started compiling data meet standard imminent disclosure rule large bank issued tender engage climate consultant assist disclosure reported rbi’s decision release climate disclosure rule aligned india’s aim diverting flow resource climate friendly sector draft framework recently released ahead 2025 united nation climate change conference cop30 held brazil november india aim achieve net zero carbon emission 2070 preparing publish fresh national emission reduction target

His secrets were discovered by the Mangaluru Police after they conducted a raid at his luxurious home.

The process of his fraud was simple: First, he built trust by flaunting his wealth, then he proceeded with legal formalities, and finally vanished after collecting crores of rupees from his targets.

The police arrested him during the investigation, which left the officials shocked. Saldanha posed as a high-level financier and used his lavish bungalow in Jappinamogaru, Mangaluru, to lure investors into his trap. His targets were wealthy and ultra-rich entrepreneurs and individuals.

How did Rohan Saldanah set his bait

To kickstart his scam, Saldanha would invite clients to his luxurious home and office. After their visit and gaining their trust, he offered to arrange loans worth Rs 100 crore or more. To make the offer seem more authentic, he went a step further and introduced a fake lawyer, using the name of a well-known lawyer from the region. This led clients to believe in the legitimacy of the deal and even reached out to the lawyer for document verification and other legal formalities. He would then demand money from the clients for registration and stamp duty. This tactic alone brought him crores, and in some cases, he managed to extract up to Rs 10 crore from his ‘clients’. Once he received the money, he would disappear without a trace, leaving the victims devastated.

Police discovery

While searching his bungalow, the police uncovered more than just lavish interiors. His home had secret sections and hidden compartments, designed to be nearly undetectable, meant for sudden disappearances. Officers said that closets concealed these hidden areas, which allowed him to remain undetected whenever he needed. Investigators believe this setup helped him evade suspicious clients, unannounced visitors, and even law enforcement, allowing him to cut contact during critical moments.

In just a few months, the accused allegedly carried out fraudulent transactions amounting to Rs 40–50 crore. However, the total fraud committed over the years is believed to be significantly higher. So far, the police have filed three cases, two in Mangaluru and one in Chitradurga. Authorities suspect many more victims may be staying silent out of fear or shame. Acting on a complaint from one of the victims, Mangaluru Police arrested Rohan Saldanha and have since widened the investigation to uncover the full extent of his activities. They are also probing possible collaborators and urging other victims to come forward.",rohan saldanha 45 year old ‘financier’ scammed several businessmen industrialist mangaluru duped 10 crore money secret discovered mangaluru police conducted raid luxurious home process fraud simple first built trust flaunting wealth proceeded legal formality finally vanished collecting crore rupee target police arrested investigation left official shocked saldanha posed high level financier used lavish bungalow jappinamogaru mangaluru lure investor trap target wealthy ultra rich entrepreneur individual rohan saldanah set bait kickstart scam saldanha would invite client luxurious home office visit gaining trust offered arrange loan worth r 100 crore make offer seem authentic went step introduced fake lawyer using name well known lawyer region led client believe legitimacy deal even reached lawyer document verification legal formality would demand money client registration stamp duty tactic alone brought crore case managed extract r 10 crore ‘clients’ received money would disappear without trace leaving victim devastated police discovery searching bungalow police uncovered lavish interior home secret section hidden compartment designed nearly undetectable meant sudden disappearance officer said closet concealed hidden area allowed remain undetected whenever needed investigator believe setup helped evade suspicious client unannounced visitor even law enforcement allowing cut contact critical moment month accused allegedly carried fraudulent transaction amounting r 40–50 crore however total fraud committed year believed significantly higher far police filed three case two mangaluru one chitradurga authority suspect many victim may staying silent fear shame acting complaint one victim mangaluru police arrested rohan saldanha since widened investigation uncover full extent activity also probing possible collaborator urging victim come forward

The foreign nationals came to Delhi to attend the congregation at Nizamuddin Markaz in 2020 during Covid outbreak.

The accused persons were booked under the provisions of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the Epidemic Diseases Act, the Disaster Management Act and the Foreigners Act. The Tablighi Jamaat congregation was an early epicentre of COVID-19 outbreak in the country, as members from various states had attended the event and returned to their places carrying the virus after they were infected at the event.

Hearing a batch of petitions moved by advocate Ashima Mandla, Justice Neena Bansal Krishna said, “Chargesheets quashed.” The verdict in this case was reserved in April this year, and the same was pronounced on 17th July.

The case, associated with the Tablighi Jamaat gathering, was under legal examination due to its alleged impact on public health and its adherence to regulatory guidelines during the pandemic.

Representing the 70 Indian nationals, advocate Ashima Mandla earlier placed on record a compilation of judgements passed by other courts in relation to the incident. Advocate Mandakini Singh also appeared on behalf of the Petitioners.

The accused named in the matter were identified as Mohammad Anwar, Mohd. Tayyab, Sadar Irfan, Muktara, Mohd. Tahir, Shamim, Akhtar, Taijumal Islam, Attar Rehman, Majid Miyan, Basheer Ali, Mohd. Bilal Sheikh, Niyauddin Parveen Khan, Noor Bano Nashreen, Shahin Bee, Rubina Rao, Hussain, Mohd, Aslam, Mohd. Umar, Shahroz Anwar, Noor Ahmed, among others.

In April this year, the bench of Justice Neena Bansal reserved the judgement in a batch matter of 16 FIRs involving 70 Indian nationals associated with Tablighi Jamaat who were chargesheeted under sections 188/269/270/120-B IPC for housing foreign nationals in different masjids during the Covid-19 outbreak between March 24, 2020 and March 30, 2020.

The 195 foreign nationals who were housed by these Indian nationals were also named in the FIR; however, in most chargesheets, they were not chargesheeted or cognisance refused by the Trial Court, on principles of double jeopardy, as the same set of foreign nationals were chargesheeted for the same set of offences and had entered plea bargaining for purposes of repatriation or were discharged in an FIR.

What the Delhi High Court said in its judgement

The defence contended that FIRs against the accused persons be quashed on the grounds that allegations levelled against Indian Nationals in the aforesaid FIRs are prima facie “embellishments and exaggerations” which stare in the face of the record and are an abuse of the process of criminal law.

The petitioners further argued against allegations made against them that they were allegedly housed at Masjid Ek Minar, Haveli Kallu Khawas, Chitli Qabar, Delhi, for some time and remained housed till intervention by the Police officials on 01.04.2020. It is asserted that the allegations levelled in the impugned FIRs are bereft of legality as there are no specific allegations or evidence qua Petitioners for hosting or participating in a social/cultural/religious gathering which was essentially barred under Section 144 Cr.P.C.

The petitioners also submitted that a total ban on movement, i.e. Janta Curfew, was imposed on 22.03.2020, while Section 144 was imposed on 24.03.202,0, and a complete nationwide Lockdown was directed w.e.f. 25.03.2020, rendering the Petitioners remediless who had no recourse but to continue staying inside the Masjid, until taken into Institutional quarantine. The Petitioners, therefore, cannot be charged under

Section 188 IPC for merely residing in a mosque, and the charges are liable to be quashed. They also disputed the offence under Section 188 IPC, saying that for taking cognisance of an offence under Section 188 IPC, a written complaint of the Public Servant whose order has been contravened is mandatory. The prosecution for the offence under Section 188 IPC cannot be initiated based on the Chargesheet filed by the Police.

In addition, the petitioners argued that slapping IPC section 269 against the accused was inappropriate as no offence under this Section has been made out against the Petitioners. They further claimed that the addition of this section has fuelled prejudice and stigmatisation of the accused persons.

The court discussed the maintainability of the petition for quashing of the FIRs against the accused persons. After detailing the grounds for deeming the plea maintainable, the court delved into the sustainability of section 188 IPC in the Absence of Complaint by competent authority.

While the petitioners contended that the entire investigations have been undertaken by the Police without there being any complaint and thus be set aside, the prosecution alleged violation of order under Section 144 Cr.P.C. dated 24.03.2020 promulgated by ACPs of Darya Ganj, Sarai Rohilla and Krishna Nagar.

Regarding this the court said, “the record shows that a Complaint by the competent public officer had been made to the Court along with the Chargesheet and the cognizance has been taken on the basis of that Complaint. It cannot be said that there was no compliance of Section 195 Cr.P.C. in the present cases.”

The court highlighted that as per section 188 IPC, the Notification of the public servant must be in the actual knowledge of the person required him to do or abstain from doing some act. Acquiring or gaining of such knowledge is a pre-requisite. Any proof of general Notification promulgated by a public servant, would not satisfy the requirement. The court pointed out that the promulgation of a notification needs to be carried out by the issuing authority, although the law does not prescribe any specific mode to make the order known publicly and openly.

In the present case, the court said that it is not the case of the respondents that the Janta Curfew order was served on the petitioners by whatever means or was affixed on the premises or was gazetted on the relevant date.

The single judge bench noted that the State’s assertion that the requisite knowledge must be attributed to the petitioners, because the order was published in some newspapers, TV channels and social websites, etc, does not meet the requirement of promulgation since there is no averment that the newspapers/handbills were received by the Petitioner.

“There is no averment whatsoever to show that any information was actually conveyed to the Petitioners,” the court noted, adding that had there been any evidence of the Notification being published in the public media, there may have been a presumption of knowledge to the persons residing in the house, but there is no evidence to this effect as well.

While the court’s remarks suggest that there is no evidence of the notification being published in the public media, the same was widely reported in the media at that time.

The question here arises as to how the authorities would have ensured that everyone was informed about the order imposing a total ban on movement. By personally visiting each and every person’s residence or visiting the Markaz in this case? At a time when Covid-related news and updates dominated local or national television news headlines, digital media and social media discourse, is it really unlikely that the most of the people including the accused persons who must have had access to their mobile phones, if not television or newspapers, remained unaware of the notification issued under Section 144 Cr.P.C?

The Delhi High Court further observed that there is no evidence to show that the Tablighi Jamaat congregation, which was planned way before the outbreak of Covid, was held after the promulgation of the notification under Section 144.

“Firstly and foremost, there is nothing on record to show that they had congregated after the promulgation of the Notification under Section 144 Cr.P.C. These Petitioners were already present in the Markaz and after the imposition of the complete lockdown, there was no way possible for them to have dispersed; rather their stepping out of the houses would have been violation of the complete lockdown and also of the potential of spreading of commutable disease of COVID-19,” the court said, adding the accused persons were “helpless people, who got confined on account of lockdown.”

The court also remarked that the chargesheet filed by the Delhi Police does not make any mention of any of the accused persons being found Covid-19 positive or having stepped out of the Markaz after 24th March 2020.

“There is not a whisper in the entire Chargesheet that any of these petitioners were found COVID-19 positive or that they had stepped out of the Markaz after 24.03.2020 or that they were likely to spread COVID-19. Also, there is not a single averment of them having not rendered any assistance to the surveillance personnel,” the court said.

All excerpts taken from relevant court order

Moreover, the court said that even if it is assumed that there was “due promulgation” of the notification under section 144, “no violation of any of the activities prohibited by the Notification has been made out in the entire chargesheet.”

“It is therefore, held that the cognizance for the offence under Section 188 IPC is bad as no prima facie case is made out and the Petitioners are entitled to be discharged under Section 188 IPC,” the court said.

Quashing the charges under IPC sections 269 and 270, the court observed that the prosecution did not produce any material evidence to prove that the accused had indulged in any act which contributed to the spread of Covid. “No material was produced in the chargesheet and no evidence was placed on record to substantiate the fulfilment of ingredients of Sections 269 and 270 IPC… Even if all the evidence as put forth in the chargesheet is admitted, no offence under Sections 269 and 270 IPC has even prima facie been made out…,” the court ruled.

Charges under Section 3 of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, and Section 51 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, were also quashed since “… there is no averment of any government official being obstructed or there being any refusal to comply with any directions issued by the government. No offence under Section 51 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, has therefore, been made out… There is no averment about which order taken out under the Disaster Management Act has been violated. It is not shown that there was any criminal act, whether under the Disaster Management Act or the Epidemic Diseases Act, committed by the petitioners. The FIRs under these two sections are also liable to be quashed.”

In conclusion, the court order dated 17th July 2025, stated: “In the light of the aforesaid discussion, it is held that no offence under Sections 188/269/270/271 of IPC and Section 3 of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, Section 51 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005 is even prima facie made out in the Chargesheets.”

What the Delhi Police’s chargesheet had stated

The Delhi Police Crime Branch registered an FIR under various sections of the IPC, the Epidemic Diseases Act, the Disaster Management Act, and against Indian and foreign nationals in connection with alleged violations during the COVID-19 outbreak

A series of chargesheets were filed, with many foreign nationals entering plea bargains. Additionally, 28 FIRs were registered across Delhi against 193 individuals, leading to quashing petitions before the Delhi High Court. Questions arose regarding the legal validity of charges against petitioners, particularly under sections of the IPC that require specific procedural conditions. Courts across India have previously quashed similar cases, citing ‘procedural lapses’ and ‘insufficient evidence’.

It must be recalled that in the last week of March 2020, hundreds of Tablighi Jamaat attendees were found living inside the markaz, many of whom were in violation of their visa rules. Many of the attendees were reportedly found to be COVID-19 positive, and despite showing symptoms, had continued to stay there or move to the interiors of the country without getting themselves tested. Subsequently, many were moved to quarantine centres to ensure treatment and arrest the spread of the virus. However, even then, many Tablighi Jamaat attendees had attacked healthcare workers and even created ruckus at quarantine centres.

The Delhi Police’s chargesheet filed against the Tablighi Jamaat mentions that the Malaysian and Indonesian nationals who attended the gathering were carriers of the deadly virus and which led initial wave of coronavirus in India. The charge sheet talks about similar gatherings in Malaysia, which ended up being a super-spreader event. It also talked about a cancelled event in Indonesia where Covid-19 cases were reported before the outbreak in Delhi. Markaz Nizamuddin became the Covid hotspot and allegedly played a vital role in spreading it across the country.

Police mentioned in the chargesheet that the gathering in Malaysia between 27th and 1st March 2020, resulted in 500 COVID-19 cases in that country. An event scheduled for 18th March in Indonesia was cancelled because of the authorities’ concerns. By that time, 25 people were already dead, and 309 were infected in that country. The chargesheet said that people from Malaysia, Indonesia, and other countries came to India to participate in the Markaz gathering in Nizamuddin. As per the police, they acted as carriers of the virus.

In the chargesheet, it was said that the CDMO/Southeast district contacted Markaz authorities on 19th March and asked to maintain social distancing and ensure home quarantine after an Indonesian man tested positive in Telangana. He had a history of travelling to Delhi for the Markaz gathering. Delhi Police contacted a Markaz official named Haji Yunus and asked him that there should not be more than 20 Jamaatis in Nizamuddin at any given time.

On 21st March 2020, Delhi Police called Mufti Shahzad and asked him to immediately ensure that foreign nationals leave for their respective states or countries. When the lockdown was announced on 24th March, Delhi Police issued prohibitory orders, but no official from Benglewali Masjid Markaz took any precautionary steps. On 25th March, a medical team was sent for the first time as there were reports that no one was following social distancing orders, and a Jamaati from Bangladesh started to show symptoms of COVID-19. On inspection, the police found that there were 526 foreign nationals and 1,183 Indians at the Markaz.

It must be recalled that in back in April 2020, in Haryana’s Palwal, three Bangladeshi men who attended the Tabilghi Jamaat event in Delhi’s Nizamuddin had tested positive. These Bangladeshi nationals, along with several other,s stayed in various mosques in villages of the Palwal area after attending the Delhi event of Tablighi Jamaat.

On 28th March 2020, the SHO of Hazrat Nizamuddin sent a written complaint to DCP Crime Branch and informed them about the alleged violation by the head of Markaz Maulana Saad and management. Lawyer for Tabhligi Jamaat, advocate Mujeez Rehman said, What good is an advisory by the administration at that time, asking to ensure social distancing? Tablighi members were self-isolated in Nizamuddin. Authorities should have shut down airports, screened passengers, and undertaken contact tracing.”

Once police started to track Jamaatis across countries, they found clusters of Covid positive cases across the country who came in contact with these Markaz members. The information provided by Markaz was incomplete or unverified in many cases, and it became hard for the administration to track jamaatis on time. They even tried to project that it is a conspiracy of the Indian government to defame Jamaatis.

It must be recalled that back in April 2020, the Deputy Commissioner of South Andaman District ordered to register FIR against two people Farzan Ali and S Rehman. who tested positive for COVID-19 for giving misleading information as authorities tried tracing their contacts. The duo, who had attended the controversial Islamic event in Delhi, have been giving wrong information about the places they visited during the home quarantine period apart from violating the terms and conditions of home quarantine

The Central government had told the Supreme Court in an earlier statement that the Markaz management deliberately disregarded police instructions to send back its members.

However, in the present case, the Delhi High Court not only quashed all the charges against the accused persons but court observations also present the accused as some sort of victims who have been needlessly villainised.",18th july 2025 delhi high court quashed 16 fir filed 70 indian citizen accused sheltering 190 foreign member tablighi jamaat foreign national came delhi attend congregation

Additionally, he attempted to burn the national flag. He is also accused of forcing Quran and Namaz upon the students.

The matter pertains to a secondary school in the village of Nagpura, located in Mahidpur. A student of the institution informed his uncle, Rohit Rathore, about the Muslim man’s outrageous actions.

According to the students, on 11th July, he destroyed the images of Lord Ganesha, Goddess Saraswati and Bharat Mata in front of the students and set them ablaze. According to media reports, Rohit Rathore came to the school following a complaint on 16th July.

He talked to other students who witnessed the incident and confirmed that the same was true. The families of other pupils then came together and captured visuals of the destroyed pictures after which the recordings were handed over to the authorities.

Afterward, Rohit Rathore launched a complaint against the accused. He informed that his nephew, Anurag Rathore is a student in the sixth grade at Madhyamik Vidyalaya Nagpur. He disclosed Shakeel Mohammad had burnt photographs of Hindu gods and Bharat Mata before the students and threatened to kill them if they revealed the occurrence to anyone.

Furthermore, the perpetrator exerted pressure on students to perform Namaz and read Quran during class and declared that he will instruct them how to do it. He also used offensive language towards the parents of the students. He reportedly behaved in a similar manner when he taught at the school in the Lasudiya Mansoor area previously. He has been known to repeat such actions while serving at other schools as well.

Shakeel Mohammad has been arrested and a case has been booked under section 298, 351(3) of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) against him. The police presented him in Mahidpur court and sent him to jail. District Education Officer Anand Sharma has also suspended him from his position.

Hindu organistaions also protested after the matter came to light. The workers of Vishva Hindu Parishad and Bajrang Dal surrounded the police station and demonstrated against him.

In the 18th package of the sanctions announced today, the EU targets Russian oil exports, including refining of Russian oil in other countries. This includes “the biggest Rosneft refinery in India,” and the Indian flag registry.

EU has also announced that the Nord Stream pipelines will be banned. The union has lowered the cap on Russian oil prices to 15% below market prices, to hit the oil revenue earned by Russia.

European Commission’s vice president Kaja Kallas, also the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, made the announcements in a post on X. She called it one of its strongest sanctions package against Russia to date

Kallas wrote, “The EU just approved one of its strongest sanctions package against Russia to date. We’re cutting the Kremlin’s war budget further, going after 105 more shadow fleet ships, their enablers, and limiting Russian banks’ access to funding. Nord Stream pipelines will be banned. A lower oil price cap. We are putting more pressure on Russia’s military industry, Chinese banks that enables sanctions evasion, and blocking tech exports used in drones.”

For the first time, we're designating a flag registry and the biggest Rosneft refinery in India.



Our sanctions also hit those indoctrinating Ukrainian children.



We will keep raising the costs, so stopping the aggression becomes the only path forward for Moscow. (3/3) — Kaja Kallas (@kajakallas) July 18, 2025

Kallas further added, “For the first time, we’re designating a flag registry and the biggest Rosneft refinery in India. Our sanctions also hit those indoctrinating Ukrainian children. We will keep raising the costs, so stopping the aggression becomes the only path forward for Moscow.”

The EU also imposed new restrictions on Russian banks, resulting in 20 more Russian banks being cut off from SWIFT, the international payment settlement system.

While the EU has not named the refinery in India that processes Russian oil, the sanction has been imposed on Vadinar oil refinery at Vadinar, Gujarat. Constructed by Essar Oil, it is currently owned and operated by Nayara Energy Limited, in which Rosneft owns a 49.13% stake.

Kallas also mentioned that a flag registry in India is also being sanctioned. A flag registry contains the list of ships that fly the flags of a country. By sanctioning, EU will have the power to take action against Indian flag carrying ships for their purported support to Russian oil trade.

Notably, EU has not banned the sale of Russian oil, but has sanctioned the sale of Russian Oil above the price cap, which is set 15% lower to the market cap.",european union announced latest round sanction russia war ukraine 18th package sanction announced today eu target russian oil export including refining russian oil country includes “the biggest rosneft refinery india ” indian flag registry eu also announced nord stream pipeline banned union lowered cap russian oil price 15 market price hit oil revenue earned russia european commission’s vice president kaja kallas also eu high representative foreign affair security policy made announcement post x called one strongest sanction package russia date kallas wrote “the eu approved one strongest sanction package russia date we’re cutting kremlin’s war budget going 105 shadow fleet ship enablers limiting russian banks’ access funding nord stream pipeline banned lower oil price cap putting pressure russia’s military industry chinese bank enables sanction evasion blocking tech export used drone ” first time designating flag registry biggest rosneft refinery india sanction also hit indoctrinating ukrainian child keep raising cost stopping aggression becomes path forward moscow 3 3 — kaja kallas kajakallas july 18 2025 kallas added “for first time we’re designating flag registry biggest rosneft refinery india sanction also hit indoctrinating ukrainian child keep raising cost stopping aggression becomes path forward moscow ” eu also imposed new restriction russian bank resulting 20 russian bank cut swift international payment settlement system eu named refinery india process russian oil sanction imposed vadinar oil refinery vadinar gujarat constructed essar oil currently owned operated nayara energy limited rosneft owns 49 13 stake kallas also mentioned flag registry india also sanctioned flag registry contains list ship fly flag country sanctioning eu power take action indian flag carrying ship purported support russian oil trade notably eu banned sale russian oil sanctioned sale russian oil price cap set 15 lower market cap

It has been revealed that humans lived in that are around 4,000 years ago. Scientists who were searching for additional information about the captivating location in the Raichur district made the discovery. A collaborative team of 20 researches from India, Canada and the United States worked together to learn more about the area’s past.

Researchers have been excavating around Mallikarjun Hill, close to the Mallikarjuna Temple and the town’s Anjaneya Swamy temple. They have come across a variety of artefacts and other tools that date back four millennia which suggests that the area was once a vibrant settlement.

Professor Dr Andrew M. Bauer of Stanford University in the United States, Dr. Peter G. Johansen of McGill University in Canada and Hemanth Kadambi of Shiv Nadar University in Delhi-NCR (National Capital Region) alongside their team of over 20 researchers have been seeking evidence of human habitation and civilisation in Maski for the past three months.

They approached Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) for approval and afterward the crew began exploring Maski. The scientists identified 271 places of interest in the area and began their work. They unearthed evidence that the area surrounding the temple and Mallikarjun Hill was occupied by people from the 11th to the 14th century BCE.

They located an array of antiquities, including cooking tools like earthen pots and pans. Kadambi declared, “We have found evidence that indicates that there was a human settlement in Maski around 4,000 years ago.”

Maski inscription

Notably, British gold mine engineer C. Beadon found the Maski inscription in 1915. The region made its place on the archaeological map when the inscription, which dates to the time of the Mauryan emperor Ashoka, came to light. It was etched onto a rock surface within a cave.

One of the earliest inscriptions from the Mauryan era, it prominently displays the emperor’s name and his title as “Devanampriya” (Beloved of the Gods). A long-standing disagreement about whether the legendary ruler was actually referred to by the title or not was resolved when the same was mentioned alongside his name. It was written in Brahmi script and in the Prakrit language, highlighting his adherence to non-violence.",remarkable archaeological finding drawn attention karnataka’s maski town revealed human lived around 4 000 year ago scientist searching additional information captivating location raichur district made discovery collaborative team 20 research india canada united state worked together learn area’s past researcher excavating around mallikarjun hill close mallikarjuna temple town’s anjaneya swamy temple come across variety artefact tool date back four millennium suggests area vibrant settlement professor dr andrew bauer stanford university united state dr peter g johansen mcgill university canada hemanth kadambi shiv nadar university delhi ncr national capital region alongside team 20 researcher seeking evidence human habitation civilisation maski past three month approached archaeological survey india asi approval afterward crew began exploring maski scientist identified 271 place interest area began work unearthed evidence area surrounding temple mallikarjun hill occupied people 11th 14th century bce located array antiquity including cooking tool like earthen pot pan kadambi declared “we found evidence indicates human settlement maski around 4 000 year ago ” maski inscription notably british gold mine engineer c beadon found maski inscription 1915 region made place archaeological map inscription date time mauryan emperor ashoka came light etched onto rock surface within cave one earliest inscription mauryan era prominently display emperor’s name title “devanampriya” beloved god long standing disagreement whether legendary ruler actually referred title resolved mentioned alongside name written brahmi script prakrit language highlighting adherence non violence

In the first week of March 2025, the victim boarded a bus and reached Nanpara town in the Bahraich district to meet Abdul Rehman, who took the victim to his house. Rehman later kept the victim at the homes of his various relatives and raped her on multiple occasions. When the victim got pregnant, he forced her to undergo an abortion.

The victim was found abandoned by the police in the Chaugain village in the Buxar district of Bihar. She was rescued and handed over to her relatives after a medical examination. A case was registered by the police on the complaint of Yogendra Mani Tripathi, president of a social organisation named Sadbhavna, on 15th July under sections 137(2), 87, 142, 64(2)(m), 89 of the BNS and sections 5(L)/6, 5(J)(II)/6 of the POCSO Act. Along with the main accused Abdul Rehman, the Police have arrested his father Naseer, his brother-in-law Israfil, his sister Alimun, and a local villager Maiku.

SHO, 3 constables suspended for taking 1.2 lakh bribe; six arrested for raping and converting minor Hindu girl.

According to police, on an earlier occasion, the accused Abdul Rehman went to Nainital and picked up the victim. However, she was handed over to her parents by the police. This time, the minor victim came to meet Abdul Rehman and he kept her at homes of his relatives for about two months.

Role of cops under scrutiny

Some local police personnel are also facing scrutiny for their role in the entire incident. On finding prima facie evidence of negligence in relation to the case, Superintendent of Police Ghanshyam Chaursia ordered the suspension and initiation of departmental proceedings against Sub-inspector Atul Yadav, Constable Girish Sharma (Police Station Sonwa), Constable Vijay Yadav, and Constable Devesh Shukla (Police Station Malhipur).

OpIndia,17/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/10-cases-of-forced-conversion-of-hindu-transgenders-from-different-states-of-india/,From giving HIV-infected injections to assault: 10 cases of forced conversion of Hindu transgenders by Muslim transgenders from different states of India,"A troubling case of forced conversion transpired in Indore of Madhya Pradesh where Hindu transgenders charged their Muslim peers with pushing them to embrace Islam and stated that they were given injections infected with HIV after they refused to comply. As a result, 60 transgenders contracted HIV.

Hindu transgender leader Sakina Guru took the names of Seema Haji also known as Farzana and Payal alias Naeem Ansari as the prime accused. Out of fear, many Hindu transgenders have become Muslims. Those who remained steadfast in their faith and refused to submit have been subjected to HIV-infected injections. Currently, over 100 such victims are present in Indore.

A formal complaint was submitted to the Chief Justice of India, the Prime Minister’s Office, the Chief Minister’s Office, the District Magistrate and the Police Commissioner.Afterward,, a Special Investigation Team had been established to look into the matter. However, this is not the first instance as over the years, numerous cases have emerged where Muslim transgenders pressurised Hindu members of the community to convert. These instances have been reported from states such as Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh.

Threats of social exclusion

Muslim transgenders intimidated Hindu transgenders to convert to Islam in the Sakri region of Bilaspur district, Chhattisgarh. The victim, Asma disclosed that Raja exerts pressure on them to provide sandalwood and impose charges ranging from Rs 10,000 to Rs 19,000 for the service. She added that failure to comply results in threats of social ostracism, including physical harm perpetrated by hired thugs. On 6th May, a formal complaint was lodged with the Superintendent of Police regarding the matter.

Assault for conversion

A Muslim transgender compelled Sita, also known as Sapna, to convert to Islam in Kesorpur village of Bibinagar area of Bulandshahr, Uttar Pradesh. She unveiled that her ustad (leader/teacher) forcibly kept her hostage inside a room and assaulted her after she declined to embrace Islam. She managed to escape from her captor and subsequently filed a First Information Report (FIR) with the police.

Dalit Hindu transgender thrashed brutally

Dalit Hindu transgender Muskan filed a complaint with the police concerning the attempts to convert her and a violent assault. The incident occurred in the jurisdiction of the Mansurpur police station in Muzaffarnagar. She charged that Preeti, Kaushar Ali and Guddu severely thrashed her for refusing to embrace Islam. Additionally, she was obstructed from performing puja-paath. She added that Kaushar Ali introduces himself as Geeta. Preeti, although a Muslim, has a Hindu name. She informed that Preeti was a man who became a transgender following surgery.

Death threats and pressure to become Muslim

A Hindu transgender complained to the authorities that she was being pressured to convert to Islam in Madhya Pradesh’s Indore.. The majority of the transgenders reside in Nandlalpur, an area predominantly inhabited by Muslims and the victim was also forced to live there and participate in namaz. The perpetrators broke into her residence and threatened to kill her upon her refusal. She was even barred from conducting puja-paath.

Pressure on Hindu transgenders to convert, temple removed

Muslim transgenders exerted pressure on Hindu peers to embrace Islam by dismantling a temple, in Uttar Pradesh’s Sitapur. The latter stated that the accused were roaming in the area, trying to indoctrinate others to convert. The victims then alerted Hindu organizations regarding the matter. The police filed a case against four Muslim transgenders based on the complaint.

Hindu transgenders forced to eat meat and read namaz

Hindu transgenders in the Civil Lines police station vicinity reported that Muslim transgenders summoned thugs to assault them, in Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh. They pressured the victims to consume meat and perform namaz. Furthermore, they entered Hindu neighborhoods to collect funds. A violent confrontation erupted between the two sides amidst the chaos. The cops rushed to the scene and diffused the tension. An FIR was also launched by them.

Muslim cleric converted Hindu transgender

A transgender was converted by his peer with the assistance of a Maulana (Muslim cleric). The mother of the victim went to the Georgetown police station to file a complaint against the accused. She stated that her child, Pankaj was forcibly made to consume inappropriate substances and was subjected to physical abuse. She revealed that the cleric at Patthar Gali converted her to Islam at the behest of other transgenders.

Eat beef, accept Islam or leave

Hindu transgenders faced pressure to convert to Islam in the Jundla Gharaunda region of Karnal, Haryana. When they protested, they were threatened with expulsion from the houses. They were made to eat beef and other meat. Transgender Jyoti reported that the Muslim transgenders, Abdu Kar Rehman and Abdul Karim also known as Lallu, forcefully entered her residence and verbally assaulted her and her teacher.

Pressure on Hindu transgenders to change religion

OpIndia,17/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/kerala-govt-allows-euthanasia-of-stray-dogs-with-diseases-rabies/,Kerala govt allows euthanasia of stray dogs with diseases as rabies cases across the state cause concern,"In Kerala, the state government has allowed local bodies to conduct euthanasia of diseased stray dogs in accordance with the provisions of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Animal Husbandry Practices and Procedures) Rules 2023.

On 16th July, Minister for Local Self Governments M.B. Rajesh and Minister for Animal Husbandry J. Chinchurani announced this decision after holding a high-level cabinet meeting in view of the surge in cases of stray dog bites and deaths due to rabies.

According to the Section 8 of Animal Husbandry Rules, the euthanasia of an animal can be carried out when the Union government or the State government finds any animal which is so diseased that it can spread the disease, in order to control such diseases.

Minister Rajesh said that since the Animal Birth Control (ABC) rules do not allow euthanasia, the government relied on the Animal Husbandry Rules for allowing euthanasia of diseased stray dogs.

“The State government will again request the Union government to amend the ABC rules as it slows down the progress of ABC activities. Another challenge is the opposition from the local population against opening ABC centres. The government will take action related to obstructing public servants in discharge of public functions against those who try to impede the functioning of ABC units,” the minister said.

The Animal Husbandry Department will deploy eight ABC machines. In the next two months, the Local Self Government Department will deploy ABC machines in 152 block panchayats in Kerala.

In recent times, there has been a significant rise in the cases of rabies-caused deaths across the country. Notably, Rabies is a viral zoonosis spread most often by dogs. It is transmitted through the saliva of an infected animal, typically via a bite or a scratch. There is no cure for rabies once the patient starts exhibiting clinical symptoms, and death is 100% certain within a few days. Even minor exposure can be deadly.

While the government data show only dozens of confirmed deaths each year, for example, 21 deaths in 2022 and 54 in 2024, WHO and independent studies estimate roughly 18,000 to 20,000 deaths in India by rabies. Notably, WHO’s numbers match a 2006 press release of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change.

In a disturbing case that reveals a spreading trend of forced conversion, a Karnataka woman has exposed gruesome details of how she was lured, entrapped, and exploited in an intensely sinister religious conversion racket running from India to Saudi Arabia. The woman, Rashmi (changed name), recalled her horrible experience on a phone call with Aaj Tak, narrating the trauma, falsehood, and abuse she suffered for years.

Her journey starts in late 2019, just after the passing away of her only family, her older brother. Vulnerable and alone, she was contacted on Instagram by a person named “Raju Rathore.” At first, she did not give him any attention. But soon, a lady presenting herself as Raju’s sister-in-law began chatting with her, assuring her that Raju was reliable and seriously interested in her.

He introduced himself as a Rajput Hindu and posed with images of Hindu deities as his profile pictures. Gradually, a friendship developed, and ultimately, Raju offered her his hand in marriage. His so-called sister-in-law told her that they would be Rashmi’s new family because she no longer had anyone.

Raju, who was allegedly employed in Saudi Arabia, invited Rashmi to go there, stating that she could try her luck there for a job. A forged Aadhaar card and passport under a different identity were procured for her, although the photograph used for the documents was hers. Since she had never been abroad before and had no one to show her the way, Rashmi relied on the process. She even sold the house and beauty parlour in Karnataka to finance her new life.

When she reached Delhi, she saw Raju’s so-called sister-in-law and father, who took her to the airport. A man who took her along to Saudi Arabia told her about flight protocols and remained with her on the flight. She felt accepted, even loved. Within a matter of hours, she had begun to construct a new life.

Rashmi first met Raju at the Saudi airport. Everything appeared normal. He appeared Hindu, spoke in a familiar tone, and tended to refer to Hindu gods. Yet, just after entering the car, he made an odd telephone call, uttering, “The package has arrived.” Later on, she found out that “package” meant Indian girls being trafficked.

Rashmi was brought to a hired two-room residence in an area she remembers being referred to as something like “Al-Badiha.” There, before strangers, Raju fastened a mangalsutra around her neck and put sindoor in her hair, mimicking her marriage. Several hours later, he called someone saying, “Rashmi is ready to convert.”

She was shocked, and she asked him what he meant. He then told her that his real name was Wasim, and he wished she should convert to Islam and rename herself Ayesha. When she refused, abuse started. She was beaten and raped for three days. He locked her up in the room when he left home, and even confiscated her telephone.

Three days passed, and a man named Badr Akhtar Siddiqui visited the house. He greeted her warmly and talked about the ‘truth’ of their religion. However, when Rashmi asked him a few questions, he got angry and talked to Wasim. She heard them saying that Wasim had been paid Rs 15 lakh by the operator of the Balrampur Islamic conversion racket, Jalaluddin alias Chhangur Baba, for bringing her to Saudi Arabia.

Persuasion failed, so Wasim went darker. Wasim took a video of himself raping Rashmi and blackmailed her with it. She remained terrorised for three months, living in this hell. After her tourist visa’s term ran out, Wasim sent her back to India but held the video hostage.

In Karnataka, Rashmi attempted to restart her life, taking a small accommodation on rent and working at beauty parlours. But Wasim and his family kept their eyes on her, calling her over and over and threatening her. She switched jobs several times. From Saharanpur, individuals started calling, asking for money for all sorts of false reasons.

More than two and a half years went by in this manner, with Rashmi being trapped. Fear of her explicit video going viral stopped her from taking her life, even when life became too tough. She finally approached the police with a complaint in Karnataka. But soon she received threats, asking her to reach Saharanpur.

In May 2024, she went to Saharanpur, where the woman whom she had referred to as ‘bhabhi’ was Wasim’s actual wife. She was kidnapped a second time by an entire family. She was threatened and beaten, attempting to convert her. She begged, telling them she was a Hindu and even promised to teach them Hanuman Chalisa. They were furious at this and increased the beatings.

She attempted to get assistance from local police, but everybody was on the same page. She was invariably brought back to Wasim’s residence whenever she tried running away, quite frequently by the police themselves. They had received money from Chhangur Baba, the mastermind behind the Balarampur Islamic conversion racket, to make sure that she got converted.

In December 2024, it reached a new low. After endless threats and manipulations, she was forced to eat beef and beaten when she wouldn’t touch it. The following day, while shopping in town, she was kidnapped by 12-14 men, gagged, tied, and gang-raped.

One of Wasim’s so-called uncles also made videos of the assault. She was tortured using cigarette burns, belts, knives, bricks, and the like. Throughout, they abused her religion. That is where she was led to Chhangur Baba’s den.

Rather than assisting her, Chhangur was enraged that her face had been hit. “Who will purchase her now?” he supposedly remarked. He ordered that her wounds be treated and spiritual healing done. He placed a taweez around her neck.

She was then hospitalised with a different identity. After discharge, she was again imprisoned. With fractured bones and innumerable injuries, she managed to escape and arrived at a court nearby, where she met the members of an organisation. They introduced her to Gopal Rai, who is the President of the Vishwa Hindu Raksha Parishad.

On June 3, a ‘shuddhikaran’ was conducted for her in Lucknow, along with 15 other victims of Jalaluddin’s racket. Last week, Jalaluddin was arrested. But Rashmi asserts that his people are still around and following her.

She has been allotted a single room in the Saharanpur house where she was once imprisoned. The room has no kitchen, no toilet. The rest of the house is locked and empty. No electricity supply reaches her room after Jalaluddin’s arrest.

To survive, Rashmi goes door-to-door offering beauty services. But she is still harassed. The rapists loiter around her. Some blow cigarette smoke at her; others make obscene gestures. She keeps receiving threats from different phone numbers.

“I was an orphan. The dream of a family is what made me lose everything,” Rashmi says.

Now, she fears every day. Not only to be assaulted once more, but also of things from her past coming back to ruin whatever little harmony she was able to reconstruct.",new case coming light every day related balrampur islamic conversion racket run jalaluddin alias chhangur baba uttar pradesh disturbing case reveals spreading trend forced conversion karnataka woman exposed gruesome detail lured entrapped exploited intensely sinister religious conversion racket running india saudi arabia woman rashmi changed name recalled horrible experience phone call aaj tak narrating trauma falsehood abuse suffered year journey start late 2019 passing away family older brother vulnerable alone contacted instagram person named “raju rathore ” first give attention soon lady presenting raju’s sister law began chatting assuring raju reliable seriously interested introduced rajput hindu posed image hindu deity profile picture gradually friendship developed ultimately raju offered hand marriage called sister law told would rashmi’s new family longer anyone raju allegedly employed saudi arabia invited rashmi go stating could try luck job forged aadhaar card passport different identity procured although photograph used document since never abroad one show way rashmi relied process even sold house beauty parlour karnataka finance new life reached delhi saw raju’s called sister law father took airport man took along saudi arabia told flight protocol remained flight felt accepted even loved within matter hour begun construct new life rashmi first met raju saudi airport everything appeared normal appeared hindu spoke familiar tone tended refer hindu god yet entering car made odd telephone call uttering “the package arrived ” later found “package” meant indian girl trafficked rashmi brought hired two room residence area remembers referred something like “al badiha ” stranger raju fastened mangalsutra around neck put sindoor hair mimicking marriage several hour later called someone saying “rashmi ready convert ” shocked asked meant told real name wasim wished convert islam rename ayesha refused abuse started beaten raped three day locked room left home even confiscated telephone three day passed man named badr akhtar siddiqui visited house greeted warmly talked ‘truth’ religion however rashmi asked question got angry talked wasim heard saying wasim paid r 15 lakh operator balrampur islamic conversion racket jalaluddin alias chhangur baba bringing saudi arabia persuasion failed wasim went darker wasim took video raping rashmi blackmailed remained terrorised three month living hell tourist visa’s term ran wasim sent back india held video hostage karnataka rashmi attempted restart life taking small accommodation rent working beauty parlour wasim family kept eye calling threatening switched job several time saharanpur individual started calling asking money sort false reason two half year went manner rashmi trapped fear explicit video going viral stopped taking life even life became tough finally approached police complaint karnataka soon received threat asking reach saharanpur may 2024 went saharanpur woman referred ‘bhabhi’ wasim’s actual wife kidnapped second time entire family threatened beaten attempting convert begged telling hindu even promised teach hanuman chalisa furious increased beating attempted get assistance local police everybody page invariably brought back wasim’s residence whenever tried running away quite frequently police received money chhangur baba mastermind behind balarampur islamic conversion racket make sure got converted december 2024 reached new low endless threat manipulation forced eat beef beaten wouldn’t touch following day shopping town kidnapped 12 14 men gagged tied gang raped one wasim’s called uncle also made video assault tortured using cigarette burn belt knife brick like throughout abused religion led chhangur baba’s den rather assisting chhangur enraged face hit “who purchase ” supposedly remarked ordered wound treated spiritual healing done placed taweez around neck hospitalised different identity discharge imprisoned fractured bone innumerable injury managed escape arrived court nearby met member organisation introduced gopal rai president vishwa hindu raksha parishad june 3 ‘shuddhikaran’ conducted lucknow along 15 victim jalaluddin’s racket last week jalaluddin arrested rashmi asserts people still around following allotted single room saharanpur house imprisoned room kitchen toilet rest house locked empty electricity supply reach room jalaluddin’s arrest survive rashmi go door door offering beauty service still harassed rapist loiter around blow cigarette smoke others make obscene gesture keep receiving threat different phone number “i orphan dream family made lose everything ” rashmi say fear every day assaulted also thing past coming back ruin whatever little harmony able reconstruct

The ECI reported that approximately 18 lakh enrolled voters have died, 26 lakh have shifted, and 7 lakh names are duplicates.

The ECI revealed that nearly 97.30% of Bihar’s total 7.89 crore voters have completed the enumeration forms till now. That is more than 7.68 crore voters have already replied.

Officers such as the Chief Electoral Officer (CEO), District Election Officers (DEOs), Electoral Registration Officers (EROs), and Booth Level Officers (BLOs) are coordinating with political party workers to sanitize the voters’ list. The ECI has also published a list of 21.36 lakh voters whose forms are yet to be submitted, and approximately 52.30 lakh names of individuals who are deceased, have migrated permanently, or are listed in more than one location.

The ECI further stated that the BLOs and EROs are providing detailed lists of such voters to all political parties so that the process remains transparent. The people will be allowed a complete one-month period in order to object to or make corrections on names being added or removed from the voter list.

Opposition raises concerns

But the Opposition is strongly criticising this exercise. Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has charged the NDA alliance with attempting to delete names of people from the voter roll. She complained that voter rolls were inflated in Maharashtra elections, and now, voters are being deleted in Bihar in the guise of revision.

She stated, “Earlier, in Maharashtra, votes were tampered with by padding electoral rolls. Now, in Bihar, efforts are being made to do the same by deleting voters’ names. The ‘vote ban’ under the pretext of SIR is a plot to grab the right to vote given by the Constitution. We oppose every attempt to crush the Constitution.”

SIR exercise in Bihar

The Special Intensive Revision (SIR) is being conducted in Bihar to revise the voters’ lists for the upcoming assembly elections in the state. This kind of intensive revision occurred in the state for the last time in 2003. Due to changes such as urban migration, fatalities, new young voters, and the problem of illegal immigrants, a new verification became necessary.

BLOs have been designated to go to houses and ensure the rolls are correct. The objective is straightforward: to register all legitimate voters, eliminate illegitimate ones, and maintain transparency in the procedure.

OpIndia,17/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/1-29-lakh-bigha-land-occupied-by-bangladeshi-infiltrators-and-doubtful-citizens-freed-in-4-years-informs-assam-cm-himanta-biswa-sarma/,"1.29 lakh bigha land occupied by Bangladeshi infiltrators and doubtful citizens freed in 4 years, informs Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma","Chief Minister of Assam, Himanta Biswa Sarma stated that around 29 lakh bighas (nearly 10 lakh acres) of land in Assam is reported to be occupied by “Bangladeshi infiltrators and doubtful citizens.” He mentioned that after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government took office in 2021, a campaign was initiated to reclaim the property but they encountered international pressure to cease these actions.

He made the shocking disclosures on 21st July during a function commemorating the fourth anniversary of the Multipurpose Agricultural Project at Garukhuti in the Darang district.

This project commenced in 2021, and to date, 77,420 bighas of land (25,500 acres) have been cleared of encroachments.

“Today, the land in Garukhuti, once occupied illegally, has been converted into productive agricultural fields. This is the model we aim to replicate across encroached areas in Assam,” he conveyed.

In the last 4 years, we have freed over 42,000 acres of land from encroachers and dedicated it to public use. pic.twitter.com/AaWDKMcNTK — Himanta Biswa Sarma (@himantabiswa) July 21, 2025

According to media reports, Sarma remarked, “After the successful execution of the campaign in the Darang district, the initiative was also extended to Borsola, Lumding, Burhapahar, Pabha, Batadrava, Chapar and Paikan. In the last four years, we have reclaimed 1.29 lakh bigha (around 43,000 acres) of occupied land. A considerable portion of it is now being allocated for forest development and the citizens of the state.”

He declared, “If anyone believes that after two or three campaigns we will be intimidated, not confront them directly and bow down, they are mistaken. The martyrs of the Assam Movement will certainly be avenged.” He mentioned that during the Assam Movement from 1983 to 1985, there was a prevailing sense of defeat and many individuals had “surrendered” to the Congress which changed the political trajectory of the state.

Shankar-Madhav became Shankar-Azan

Sarma pointed out that, at a certain point, we started referring to Shankar-Madhav as Shankar-Azan. Azan Peer will continue to maintain his pivotal role, yet Madhav (Madhavdev) also has his own significant position. It is only then that our “caste” can be preserved. Srimanta Sankardev and Sri Sri Madhavdev are esteemed Vaishnav saints in Assam whereas Azan Peer was a Muslim sage who arrived there from Iraq during the 17th century.

Over 1000 bighas of land cleared in Goalpara

The Himanta government is actively involved in measures to safeguard the state’s demographic composition. As part of the drive, encroached lands have been reclaimed in various locations. On 12th July, an eviction operation took place in the Paikan Reserve Forest located in the Goalpara district. 140 hectares (equivalent to 1038 to 1040 bighas) of forest land had been unlawfully taken over predominantly by Muslims.

Tejas Mariswamy, the Divisional Forest Officer of Goalpara outlined that 1,080 families had built houses in this area. The majority of these individuals were Muslims who had migrated from adjacent regions or Bangladesh. A total of 36 bulldozers were utilized during the action and the region was divided into 6 distinct blocks. Nearly 2,500 to 2,700 structures, including houses and shops were dismantled. Over 1,000 police officers and forest guards were deployed for security purposes.

Mamata Banerjee cries “atrocities on Bengalis”

A war of words broke out on social media between Sarma and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee over the removal of infiltrators and illegal occupation in Assam. She complained that the administration is persecuting the Bengali community in Assam by singling them out, labeling it as the BJP’s divisive agenda.

However, Sarma responded that it is not the Bengalis but rather Muslim infiltrators who are being expelled from Assam. He also referenced a statement from the Supreme Court which characterized infiltration as an external invasion.",chief minister assam himanta biswa sarma stated around 29 lakh bighas nearly 10 lakh acre land assam reported occupied “bangladeshi infiltrator doubtful citizen ” mentioned bharatiya janata party bjp government took office 2021 campaign initiated reclaim property encountered international pressure cease action made shocking disclosure 21st july function commemorating fourth anniversary multipurpose agricultural project garukhuti darang district project commenced 2021 date 77 420 bighas land 25 500 acre cleared encroachment “today land garukhuti occupied illegally converted productive agricultural field model aim replicate across encroached area assam ” conveyed last 4 year freed 42 000 acre land encroacher dedicated public use pic twitter com aawdkmcntk — himanta biswa sarma himantabiswa july 21 2025 according medium report sarma remarked “after successful execution campaign darang district initiative also extended borsola lumding burhapahar pabha batadrava chapar paikan last four year reclaimed 1 29 lakh bigha around 43 000 acre occupied land considerable portion allocated forest development citizen state ” declared “if anyone belief two three campaign intimidated confront directly bow mistaken martyr assam movement certainly avenged ” mentioned assam movement 1983 1985 prevailing sense defeat many individual “surrendered” congress changed political trajectory state shankar madhav became shankar azan sarma pointed certain point started referring shankar madhav shankar azan azan peer continue maintain pivotal role yet madhav madhavdev also significant position “caste” preserved srimanta sankardev sri sri madhavdev esteemed vaishnav saint assam whereas azan peer muslim sage arrived iraq 17th century 1000 bighas land cleared goalpara himanta government actively involved measure safeguard state’s demographic composition part drive encroached land reclaimed various location 12th july eviction operation took place paikan reserve forest located goalpara district 140 hectare equivalent 1038 1040 bighas forest land unlawfully taken predominantly muslim tejas mariswamy divisional forest officer goalpara outlined 1 080 family built house area majority individual muslim migrated adjacent region bangladesh total 36 bulldozer utilized action region divided 6 distinct block nearly 2 500 2 700 structure including house shop dismantled 1 000 police officer forest guard deployed security purpose mamata banerjee cry “atrocities bengalis” war word broke social medium sarma west bengal chief minister mamata banerjee removal infiltrator illegal occupation assam complained administration persecuting bengali community assam singling labeling bjp’s divisive agenda however sarma responded bengali rather muslim infiltrator expelled assam also referenced statement supreme court characterized infiltration external invasion
OpIndia,17/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/vp-jagdeep-dhankhar-calls-it-quits-read-how-he-kept-questioning-the-judiciary-seeking-accountability-and-objecting-to-their-overreach/,"VP Jagdeep Dhankhar calls it quits: Read how he kept questioning the judiciary, seeking accountability and objecting to their overreach","On the 21st of July 2025, Vice‑President Jagdeep Dhankhar resigned and submitted his letter of resignation to President Droupadi Murmu, citing medical reasons and the need to prioritise his health.

The resignation came on the opening day of the Monsoon Session of Parliament, catching many by surprise amid a busy legislative agenda. Speculations are rife about the timing of Dhankhar’s resignation, with the opposition claiming that the reasons behind his stepping down may be far deeper than just health reasons.

In his letter to President Droupadi Murmu, Jagdeep Dhankhar invoked Article 67(a) of the Constitution to make his resignation effective immediately. Citing ongoing health challenges, he stated his intention to “prioritise health care and abide by medical advice.”

From the very onset in 2022, Dhankhar’s tenure as Vice President was marked by his vocal criticism of the judiciary, especially on the issues of its overreach and accountability. Being a seasoned lawyer himself and having a background in the Supreme Court and the Rajasthan High Court, Jagdeep Dhankhar consistently raised concerns over the alleged encroachment of the powers of the legislature and executive by the judiciary, arguing that their actions undermined the supremacy of Parliament and the balance of powers as prescribed in the Constitution.

“Judiciary cannot become executive”: When Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar warned the judiciary that its overreach might destabilise governance

Hitting back at the judiciary regarding the overturning of parliamentary amendments to the Constitution in December 2022, VP Jagdeep Dhankhar warned that the judiciary cannot become the legislative or the executive because doing so may destabilise the system of government as a whole.

Dhankhar stated during the eighth LM Singhvi memorial lecture that our judiciary, as one of the important institutions of government, cannot be the executive or legislative.

“The doctrine of separation of power is fundamental to our governance. Any incursion, howsoever subtle, in the domain of the other by one has the capacity or potential to unsettle the apple cart of governance,” then vice president stated.

“India in 2015-16 was dealing with a constitutional amendment act and as a matter of record the entire Lok Sabha voted unanimously and there was no abstention in Lok Sabha and that amendment act was passed. In Rajya Sabha, there was no opposition. We the people their ordainment came to be reflected through the most sanctified mechanisms through the applicable mechanisms. That power was undone. The world does not know of any such instance. I appeal to all judicial minds please think of a parallel in the world where a constitutional provision can be undone,” the vice president stated.

In the presence of then Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud, several Supreme Court judges, Union Ministers, then Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and several lawyers, Dhankhar further said, “Power resides in ‘We the People’ – their mandate, their wisdom… If a constitutional provision that carries the ordainment of the people at large in such a vibrant democracy is undone, what will happen? I appeal to the people here, they constitute a judicial elite class, thinking minds, intellectuals – please find out a parallel in the world where a constitutional provision can be undone.”

He also asserted that while the Indian Constitution clearly states in Article 145(3) that the court may interpret the Constitution where a serious question of law is involved. “Nowhere it say a provision can be run down.”

When VP Jagdeep Dhankhar came down heavily on the Supreme Court for scrapping the NJAC

Back in December 2022, Dhankhar criticised the Supreme Court over the 99th Constitutional Amendment Bill paving way for the National Judicial Appointment Commission (NJAC), which was undone by the Supreme Court in 2015.

“The Parliament in a much-needed historic step passed the 99th Constitutional Amendment Bill, paving the way for the National Judicial Appointment Commission (NJAC). There was unprecedented support for the above. On August 13, 2014, the Lok Sabha unanimously voted in its favour with there being no abstentions. This House too, passed it unanimously on August 14, 2014, with one abstention. Rarely in Parliamentary democracy, there has been such massive support to a Constitutional legislation,” Dhankhar said.

“This process fructified into a Constitutional prescription, after 16 State Assemblies out of 29 States ratified the Central Legislation; the President of India, in terms of Article 111, accorded his consent on December 31, 2014,” he added.

Furthermore, then Vice President, Jagdeep Dhankhar stated that this was the first time that a duly legitimised constitutional prescription was judicially undone, “This historic parliamentary mandate was undone by the Supreme Court on October 16, 2015 by a majority of 4:1 finding the same as not being in consonance with the judicially evolved doctrine of ‘Basic Structure’ of the Constitution,” said.

Dhankhar had called the scrapping of the NJAC a severe compromise of parliamentary sovereignty and disregard of the mandate of the people, of which this house and the Lok Sabha are custodians.

VP Dhankhar had also emphasised that Parliament is the exclusive and ultimate determinative of the architecture of the Constitution.

“We need to bear in mind that in democratic governance, the basis of any ‘Basic Structure’ is the prevalence of primacy of the mandate of the people reflected in the Parliament. Parliament is the exclusive and ultimate determinative of the architecture of the Constitution,” said.

It must be recalled that back in 2014, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government brought the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) Act in an attempt to change the system of appointment of judges. The NJAC was a proposed body, which would have been responsible for the appointment and transfer of judges to the higher judiciary. The NJAC Act and the Constitutional Amendment Act came into force on April 13, 2015. But the top court on October 16, 2015, struck down the NJAC Act. The verdict brought back the primacy of the collegium system of judges appointing judges.

VP Jagdeep Dhankhar differed from Supreme Court’s idea of ‘basic structure’ doctrine

In January 2023, Dhankhar once again reignited the discussion over the doctrine of the separation of powers. This time, he cited the Supreme Court’s landmark judgment in the 1973 Kesavanand Bharati case wherein the court had ruled that while Parliament had the authority to amend the Constitution, it cannot amend its basic structure.

Delivering his inaugural address at the 83rd All-India Presiding Officers Conference in Jaipur, Jagdeep Dhankhar questioned: “Are we a democratic nation?”

Asserting that all three pillars of democracy: legislature, executive and judiciary must function within their limits, then Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar said, “In a democratic society, the basis of any basic structure is supremacy of the people, sovereignty of the people, sovereignty of Parliament. Executive thrives on the sovereignty of Parliament. Legislatures and Parliament decide who will be the Chief Minister, who will be the Prime Minister. The ultimate power is with the Legislature. The Legislature decides who will be in other institutions. In such a situation, all Constitutional institutions – the Legislative, Executive, Judiciary – are required to be within their limits.”

Expressing his disagreement over the Supreme Court ruling in the Kesavanand Bharati case that the Parliament cannot amend the constitution’s basic structure, Dhankhar said, “In 1973, in the Kesavananda Bharati case, the Supreme Court gave the idea of basic structure, saying that Parliament can amend the Constitution, but not its basic structure. With due respect to the Judiciary, I cannot subscribe to this.”

‘Time has come to revisit’: When Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar questioned the involvement of the CJI in executive appointments

In February 2025, Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar questioned how the judiciary can be involved in executive appointments as the Supreme Court of India was hearing a petition seeking to include the Chief Justice of India in the selection committee for the Election Commission. He said while earlier the executive yielded to the inclusion of judges in executive functions, it was time to revisit the norms.

Speaking at the National Judicial Academy, Bhopal, Dhankhar said that such a system should not exist in a democracy like India. He wondered how the Chief Justice of India participates in the selection of the CBI director, even by “statutory prescription”.

The vice president said, “To stir your minds, how can in a country like ours or in any democracy, by statutory prescription, the Chief Justice of India participate in the selection of the CBI director! Can there be any legal rationale for it? I can appreciate that the statutory prescription took shape because the Executive of the day has yielded to a judicial verdict. But time has come to revisit.”

Jagdeep Dhankhar further said, “This surely does not merge with democracy. How can we involve the Chief Justice of India in any executive appointment?”

Dhankhar went on to say that while the Supreme Court has the power to interpret the constitution, there can be no “arrogation of authority” under the guise of interpretation. The essence and spirit which the founding fathers had in mind under Article 145(3) must be respected.”

He further advocated for an increase in the constitutional bench strength, as originally the constitution bench comprised the majority of total judges.

“When the strength of the Supreme Court was eight judges, under Article 145(3), there was a stipulation that interpretation of the Constitution would be by a bench of five judges or more. Please note, when this strength was eight, it was five. And the Constitution allows the highest court of the land to interpret the Constitution. If I analyse arithmetically, they were very sure the interpretation will be by the majority of judges, because the strength then was eight. That five stands as it is. And the number (of total judges) is more than fourfold,” he said.

VP Dhankhar’s advocacy for including domain experts in arbitral process instead of retired judges

In March 2025, Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar said that the arbitral process in India is “just an additional burden to the normal hierarchical mechanism of adjudication.”

Addressing the Colloquium organised by the India International Arbitration Centre (IIAC) at Bharat Mandapam, Dhankhar said, “Arbitrators play as much critical role as members of the bar associated with the arbiter process. Surprisingly, there is, I’m saying it with utmost restraint, absolute tight-fist control of a segment of a category that is involved with arbiter process determination. This tight-fist control emanates out of judicial feats. And if we examine it on an objective platform, it is excruciatingly painful.”

Emphasising the significance of Article 136 and its effects on the arbitration process, Dhankhar said that while Article 136 was supposed to be a narrow slit, it is hurting the arbitral process.

“The Attorney General of the country can really reflect and make a big change. Which country in the world, Attorney, tell me, has suo moto cognisance by the highest court? I’m sure I can’t look around. And Article 136 intervention was supposed to be a narrow-slit. The wall has been demolished with anything and everything under the sun, including what a magistrate has to do, what a Session Judge has to do, what a District Judge has to do, and what a High Court Judge has to do. That wall demolition is also hurting the arbitral process. All I am suggesting, in all humility and as a concerned citizen of this country, is that the issue you are debating is critical to micro and small industries. They want a facile, easy arbitral process”.

Jagdeep Dhankhar condemned Supreme Court’s “judicial overreach”, calling it an unelected ‘super Parliament’

In April 2025, VP Jagdeep Dhankhar harshly criticised the recent Supreme Court verdict regarding the powers of the Governor and the President under Articles 200 and 201 of the Constitution. In the Judgment passed on 8th April 2025, a division bench of the Supreme Court set a time limit, not envisaged in the Constitution, on the exercise of power to grant or refuse assent to a state Bill by the President and the Governor. The Supreme Court prescribed a deadline of 3 months on the President’s power to grant or refuse assent to a Bill reserved by the Governor for his consideration.

Without mincing words, VP Dhankhar questioned the Supreme Court for issuing a direction to the President of India. He reminded the Supreme Court that its power is limited to interpreting the Constitution. “We cannot have a situation where you direct the President of India, and on what basis? The only right you have under the Constitution is to interpret the Constitution under Article 145(3), ” said the Vice President in an address during the Valedictory Function of the 6th Rajya Sabha Internship Program at Vice-President’s Enclave on 17th April.

“The President is called upon to decide in a time-bound manner, and if not, it becomes law. So we have judges who will legislate, who will perform executive functions, who will act as super-parliament, and absolutely have no accountability because the law of the land does not apply to them,” he said.

Highlighting the fact that the judgment, which had the effect of modifying the concerned provisions, was delivered by a bench of two judges which did not represent the majority of the total number of judges in the Supreme Court.

“When Article 145(3) was there, the number of judges in the Supreme Court was eight, 5 out of 8, now 5 out of 30 and odd. But forget about it, the judges who issued a mandamus virtually to the President and presented a scenario that it will be the law of the land, have forgotten the power of the Constitution. How can that combination of judges deal with something under Article 145(3) if preserved, it was then for five out of eight. We need to make amends for that also now. Five out of eight would mean interpretation will be by majority. Well, five constitutes more than the majority in eight. But leave that aside. Article 142 has become a nuclear missile against Democratic forces, available to the judiciary 24 x 7,” Dhankhar said.

Notably, in the verdict passed in The State of Tamil Nadu v The Governor of Tamil Nadu and Anr, the Apex Court examined the ambit of powers of the President and the Governor conferred under Articles 200 and 201 of the Constitution. The Supreme Court held that the President should decide on the Bills sent to him by the Governor for consideration within 3 months, and that any delay beyond the prescribed time limit should be justified by recording reasons. Besides, the Court ruled that if the President fails to decide on a Bill within 3 months, then the State government can seek the issuance of the writ of mandamus from the Supreme Court against the President. The judgment has been widely criticised for alleged judicial overreach or a judicial attempt to effectively amend the constitution.

Dhankhar questioned the handling of the Justice Yashwant Varma case

Former Vice-President Dhankhar had also raised questions on how the Supreme Court handled the matter relating to the discovery of huge amounts of unaccounted cash at the house of Justice Yashwant Varma. “An event happened on the night of the 14th and 15th of March in New Delhi, at the residence of a judge. For seven days, no one knew about it. We have to ask questions to ourselves. Is the delay explainable? Condonable? Does it not raise certain fundamental questions? In any ordinary situation, and ordinary situations define the rule of law, things would have been different. It was only on 21st March, disclosed by a newspaper, that people of the country were shocked as never before, ” the Vice-President remarked.

“I support judicial independence — but ACCOUNTABILITY IS KEY.” pic.twitter.com/THpUDUe6aO — Megh Updates 🚨™ (@MeghUpdates) July 7, 2025

“Thereafter, fortunately, in the public domain, we had input from an authoritative source, the Supreme Court of India. And the input indicated culpability. Input did not lead to doubt that something was amiss. Something requires to be investigated. Now the nation waits with bated breath. The nation is restive because one of our institutions, to which people have always looked up with the highest respect and deference, was put in the dock,” he added.

Jagdeep Dhankhar: The man who questioned judicial overreach, sought accountability and advocated for balance of powers even in the face of backlash from the opposition and slandering by the leftist ecosystem

Dhankhar’s fierce critiques of what he deemed judicial overreach and encroachment of the powers of the legislature were not without pushback. Beyond the insulting mimicries, several opposition leaders labelled Dhankhar as ‘non-neutral’ and his comments slamming the judiciary ‘unconstitutional’. The opposition parties and the leftist media cabal even accused the former VP of ‘undermining’ judicial independence. Not to forget, the leftist propaganda portal The Wire went as far as to call Dhankhar a “partisan attack dog” over VP Dhankhar’s criticism of the Supreme Court for using Article 142 and calling it a “nuclear missile against democratic forces”.

Despite the slandering, mockery and criticism, Dhankhar did not shy away from raising concern over judicial overreach, particularly in matters involving a delicate balance of power among the judiciary, executive and legislature. Even in the judge Yaswant Varma case, Jagdeep Dhankhar publicly questioned the actions of the Supreme Court, raising concerns regarding accountability in a democracy wherein elected representatives are subject to scrutiny but judges are nearly immune to all sorts of accountability and scrutiny.

While the opposition and the leftist media ecosystem accused VP Dhankhar of delivering politically charged rhetoric at the behest of his ‘political masters’, the BJP, VP Dhankhar’s remarks were not politically charged or at odds with his constitutional duty, rather, his criticism of the judiciary was driven by a genuine concern over a pattern wherein the judiciary seems to be discharging the duties of President, and at times those of the Parliament as well.

Dhankhar’s courage, however, has not been surprising as even during his tenure as the governor of West Bengal, he repeatedly raised concern over post-poll violence in the state and severely criticised the TMC government for the Birbhum massacre. He remained at loggerheads with the CM Mamata Banerjee-led state government over issues pertaining to federalism and governance, condemning the near-collapse of democracy in the state.

While the opposition and its media cheerleaders mocked Jagdeep Dhankhar, belittled the importance of the Vice President’s post and projected the judiciary as somewhat sacrosanct to criticism, even moved a failed impeachment motion, Jagdeep Dhankhar stood his ground, not for personal gains, not for clout, not for political leverage, but for democracy, for constitution and the supremacy of the people’s mandate.

Several parliamentarians had earlier also raised concerns over judicial activism and overreach; however, Dhankhar’s interventions brought the debate to the forefront, triggering the judiciary, lawmakers and the public to ponder over the question of the judiciary’s role in a healthy democracy.

Jagdeep Dhankhar’s tenure as the Vice President of India and Rajya Sabha chairman will be remembered for many good reasons, especially his role as a defender of constitutional balance. He gave a fervent call for judicial accountability, critiqued judicial overreach while reiterating his belief in parliamentary supremacy. While the opposition parties gave him nothing but insults, mockery and hate, Dhankhar tried to accommodate opposition voices despite ideological differences. Dhankhar’s resignation marks the end of a chapter; however, the questions he raised about the judiciary’s role and accountability will continue to shape India’s constitutional discourse.",21st july

OpIndia,17/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/first-balasore-self-immolation-now-greater-noida-suicide-the-problem-of-harassment-of-students/,"First Balasore self-immolation, now Greater Noida suicide: Why do we need such tragedies to wake us up to the problem of harassment of students","Jyoti Sharma, a second-year student from Sharda University in Greater Noida, pursuing BDS, died by suicide in her hostel room. She passed away on July 18, Friday, reportedly after writing a suicide note. The note accuses two professors and the university administration of mental harassment. The two staff members, Mahinder and Shairy, have been arrested so far.

In the suicide letter, she wrote that she had been mentally harassed and humiliated for a long time, which caused her significant distress. She expressed her desire for the accused to face legal action. She held the teachers of PCP and Dental Materials responsible for her death.

The note reads, “They mentally harassed me. They humiliated me. I have been under stress because of them for a long time. I want them to face the same thing. I am sorry. I can’t live like this anymore. I can’t…”

Shortly after the incident came to light, students gathered and protested against the university administration, alleging negligence. They claimed Jyoti had been under immense stress due to accusations of forging signatures. A minor scuffle broke out between the protesters and the police, while the family of the deceased was seen manhandling the head of the dentistry department.

The incident occurred on Friday night, and a case has been filed at the Knowledge Park Police Station in Gautam Buddha Nagar. “The woman’s body has been sent for post-mortem, and two staff members of the university have been arrested on the basis of a complaint filed by the victim’s family,” said Additional DCP of Greater Noida, Sudhir Kumar.

He added that tension had escalated due to the anger among the deceased’s family and university students towards the administration. The anger and scuffle were defused by the police through dialogue, and peace was restored at the scene. Further legal proceedings are underway.

Dr. Ajit Kumar, the university’s Public Relations Officer, confirmed that two faculty members have been suspended. “For now, two teachers have been suspended. A committee has also been formed to investigate the matter. Action will be taken against those found guilty based on the committee’s report,” he stated.

This is not an isolated case of a student taking her life due to harassment. A similar incident took place in Odisha’s Balasore shocking self-immolation case on July 12. A 20-year-old girl set herself on fire, allegedly after enduring sexual harassment by the head of her college department. She suffered 90 percent burns and later succumbed to her injuries at AIIMS Bhubaneswar on July 14.

These brutal incidents show no discrimination based on gender or age. This was evident in the tragic case of a teenager from The Global Public School in Kerala who ended his life after reportedly being bullied, assaulted, and harassed by his schoolmates.

According to the teenager’s mother, on January 15, he was forcibly taken to the toilet and made to lick the seat; his head was then pushed into the toilet while it was flushed. He was also bullied for his skin tone. The relentless harassment severely affected his mental health, ultimately driving him to end his life by jumping from the 26th floor of their apartment building.

On April 30, 2023, a 16-year-old boy died by suicide after allegedly being mentally abused by his principal and faculty members. He purportedly left a suicide note in which he apologized to his parents and elder brothers and urged serious action against those who had harassed him. The boy allegedly died by suicide in Telangana, with his family accusing the college management and certain members of the teaching staff of harassment and holding them responsible for his death, police reported. The student, in his first year of intermediate studies at a private college in Narsingi, Telangana, was found hanging in a classroom by his friends on Tuesday night, April 30.

All these incidents reflect one painful similarity: before taking their own lives, the victims tried to express what they were going through and, in the end, wrote in their suicide notes. Instead of receiving empathy and support from those around them when they spoke up about harassment in educational institutions, their voices were often ignored. Their stories must be heard, and their grievances must be addressed before blaming the victim. Continued ignorance will only lead to more such tragedies unless educational institutions actively work towards providing safe, empathetic, and responsive environments for students.",jyoti sharma second year student sharda university greater noida pursuing bd died suicide hostel room passed away july 18 friday reportedly writing suicide note note accuses two professor university administration mental harassment two staff member mahinder shairy arrested far suicide letter wrote mentally harassed humiliated long time caused significant distress expressed desire accused face legal action held teacher pcp dental material responsible death note read “they mentally harassed humiliated stress long time want face thing sorry can’t live like anymore can’t…” shortly incident came light student gathered protested university administration alleging negligence claimed jyoti immense stress due accusation forging signature minor scuffle broke protester police family deceased seen manhandling head dentistry department incident occurred friday night case filed knowledge park police station gautam buddha nagar “the woman’s body sent post mortem two staff member university arrested basis complaint filed victim’s family ” said additional dcp greater noida sudhir kumar added tension escalated due anger among deceased’s family university student towards administration anger scuffle defused police dialogue peace restored scene legal proceeding underway dr ajit kumar university’s public relation officer confirmed two faculty member suspended “for two teacher suspended committee also formed investigate matter action taken found guilty based committee’s report ” stated isolated case student taking life due harassment similar incident took place odisha’s balasore shocking self immolation case july 12 20 year old girl set fire allegedly enduring sexual harassment head college department suffered 90 percent burn later succumbed injury aiims bhubaneswar july 14 brutal incident show discrimination based gender age evident tragic case teenager global public school kerala ended life reportedly bullied assaulted harassed schoolmate according teenager’s mother january 15 forcibly taken toilet made lick seat head pushed toilet flushed also bullied skin tone relentless harassment severely affected mental health ultimately driving end life jumping 26th floor apartment building april 30 2023 16 year old boy died suicide allegedly mentally abused principal faculty member purportedly left suicide note apologized parent elder brother urged serious action harassed boy allegedly died suicide telangana family accusing college management certain member teaching staff harassment holding responsible death police reported student first year intermediate study private college narsingi telangana found hanging classroom friend tuesday night april 30 incident reflect one painful similarity taking life victim tried express going end wrote suicide note instead receiving empathy support around spoke harassment educational institution voice often ignored story must heard grievance must addressed blaming victim continued ignorance lead tragedy unless educational institution actively work towards providing safe empathetic responsive environment student
OpIndia,17/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/truck-still-stuck-collapsed-gambhira-bridge-gujarat-as-media-blames-officials-know-what-happened/,"Truck still stuck on collapsed Gambhira bridge in Gujarat: As media blames officials, Anand district collector shares the real reason with OpIndia","After a part of the Gambhira Bridge connecting Saurashtra region and Central Gujarat collapsed on the morning of 9th July, 2025, a truck which got stuck on the bridge is still hanging there, fifteen days after the incident.

Some media reports based on the interviews of the truck driver and the owner claimed that the officials of the two districts of Anand and Vadodara are denying their accountability, which is causing unnecessary hardships to the truck driver and the owner, who have been running from pillar to post to get the truck removed. Pending EMIs are adding to the worries of the truck driver, who is not even able to claim the insurance.

A report in Divya Bhaskar quoted truck owner Ramashankar Pal as saying, ” The officials of the Anand government office are putting the responsibility on Vadodara, and the officials of Vadodara are putting the responsibility on Anand. We are tired of facing all the hassles. The officials replied that the army was also requested to remove the truck by helicopter, but there is no possibility of the truck being removed right now.”

The truck owner further told Bhaskar, “I have a loan on the truck and I have to pay an instalment of Rs 1 lakh every month. If the truck runs, I will be able to pay the instalment. The administration had given me an assurance for removing the truck, but even after so many days, I have not been able to get the truck.”

The title of the Divya Bhaskar report reads- ‘First the truck was hanging, now the officials are ‘hanging’ it: Even after 10 days of the accident, the truck is still on the Gambhira bridge, the driver is wandering to unload the truck, saying – there is an instalment of lakhs per month.’

A Gujarati News’ TV channel, GSTV wrote, ‘The government has raised its hands’, the situation of the truck owner is difficult, and no one is listening to him. It has also been claimed in this report that the truck owner has been doing the rounds of the government offices of Anand-Vadodara for ten days, but he did not get any response. “We have to pay the instalments for the truck. The bank is saying that we have to pay the instalments, while the insurance company is saying that the truck is safe, no insurance will be given,” said the truck owner as quoted by GSTV.

Anand District Collector spoke to OpIndia

When OpIndia contacted Anand District Collector Praveen Chaudhary regarding the entire matter, a different version came to light. He said that there is no dispute between the two districts, and neither is the delay due to the administration blaming each other. The reality is that the truck could not be removed due to some technical reasons that emerged during the rescue operation that lasted for several days. However, the Anand District Collectorate is providing all possible help to the truck owner.

Divulging the details about the entire incident, the Anand District Collector said, “After the bridge accident, it was impossible to take heavy machinery like cranes on the bridge due to technical reasons. The truck will need to be lifted from the front, which was damaged, using a crane. But the Road and Building Department believed that using a crane in such a situation is dangerous.” He said that the rescue operation has been going on continuously, and machines were deployed till yesterday. Now that the rescue operation is almost complete, a team from the mechanical wing of the Road and Building Construction Department is working on it in collaboration with a private company and experts from High Speed Railway Corporation Limited.

“Whether the truck should be pulled back or lifted by providing some support from below is being contemplated. It also has to be seen that there is no danger to any human life in this,” the District Collector said.

The truck was not removed, as a rescue operation was going on

The reason for the delay in removing the truck is that the rescue operation went on for several days after the accident. A tanker was not found, so a sonar machine was brought from Mumbai to search and locate it underwater. When the NDRF started the rescue operation after the incident, the district administration was requested to keep the stranded truck tied so that it would not pose any danger to the rescue efforts going on under the bridge, as the rescue operation was a priority at that time.

After discussing with the NDRF team, the district administration tied the truck to a crane from the back to ensure that the rescue operation went on unaffected. When the Army was consulted, it said that pushing or pulling the truck would require the involvement of people and would put their lives in danger. At present, technical teams of the Road and Building Department are working on the strategy to remove the truck ,and it will be disposed of soon. Teams from both the district administrations are also assisting in the operation.

The collector also clarified the issue of insurance and EMI

The Anand District Collector said that the truck owner visited his office and met him and the additional district magistrate, who explained everything to him. The owner agreed for the truck to be destroyed, but it has to be done in such a way that does not put any life in danger. The plan to do this is being worked out.

As far as insurance is concerned, the District Collector said that he met the insurance company. The company said that if the government gave a written certificate of the incident, they would approve the insurance claim. The collector’s office has also given assurance in this regard, and the written process will be completed with the company.

Regarding EMI, the collector said that although this is a matter between the bank and the truck owner, the administration cannot directly interfere in it, yet he wrote a letter to the bank and requested it to postpone the instalment for two to three months on humanitarian grounds. Also, a representation will be sent to the State Level Bankers Committee, so that the truck owner can get relief on EMI.

The District Collector made it clear that this is not an Anand-Vadodara issue. The area where this incident happened and the truck got stuck is entirely in Vadodara, but since the Vadodara administration was continuously engaged in the rescue operation, the Anand district administration stepped in and provided all possible assistance.",part gambhira bridge connecting saurashtra region central gujarat collapsed morning 9th july 2025 truck got stuck bridge still hanging fifteen day incident medium report based interview truck driver owner claimed official two district anand vadodara denying accountability causing unnecessary hardship truck driver owner running pillar post get truck removed pending emis adding worry truck driver even able claim insurance truck hanging broken gambhira bridge image via x theskindoctor13 report divya bhaskar quoted truck owner ramashankar pal saying ” official anand government office putting responsibility vadodara official vadodara putting responsibility anand tired facing hassle official replied army also requested remove truck helicopter possibility truck removed right ” truck owner told bhaskar “i loan truck pay instalment r 1 lakh every month truck run able pay instalment administration given assurance removing truck even many day able get truck ” title divya bhaskar report read ‘first truck hanging official ‘hanging’ even 10 day accident truck still gambhira bridge driver wandering unload truck saying – instalment lakh per month ’ gujarati news’ tv channel gstv wrote ‘the government raised hands’ situation truck owner difficult one listening also claimed report truck owner round government office anand vadodara ten day get response “we pay instalment truck bank saying pay instalment insurance company saying truck safe insurance given ” said truck owner quoted gstv anand district collector spoke opindia opindia contacted anand district collector praveen chaudhary regarding entire matter different version came light said dispute two district neither delay due administration blaming reality truck could removed due technical reason emerged rescue operation lasted several day however anand district collectorate providing possible help truck owner divulging detail entire incident anand district collector said “after bridge accident impossible take heavy machinery like crane bridge due technical reason truck need lifted front damaged using crane road building department believed using crane situation dangerous ” said rescue operation going continuously machine deployed till yesterday rescue operation almost complete team mechanical wing road building construction department working collaboration private company expert high speed railway corporation limited “whether truck pulled back lifted providing support contemplated also seen danger human life ” district collector said truck removed rescue operation going reason delay removing truck rescue operation went several day accident tanker found sonar machine brought mumbai search locate underwater ndrf started rescue operation incident district administration requested keep stranded truck tied would pose danger rescue effort going bridge rescue operation priority time discussing ndrf team district administration tied truck crane back ensure rescue operation went unaffected army consulted said pushing pulling truck would require involvement people would put life danger present technical team road building department working strategy remove truck disposed soon team district administration also assisting operation collector also clarified issue insurance emi anand district collector said truck owner visited office met additional district magistrate explained everything owner agreed truck destroyed done way put life danger plan worked far insurance concerned district collector said met insurance company company said government gave written certificate incident would approve insurance claim collector’s office also given assurance regard written process completed company regarding emi collector said although matter bank truck owner administration cannot directly interfere yet wrote letter bank requested postpone instalment two three month humanitarian ground also representation sent state level banker committee truck owner get relief emi district collector made clear anand vadodara issue area incident happened truck got stuck entirely vadodara since vadodara administration continuously engaged rescue operation anand district administration stepped provided possible assistance
OpIndia,17/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/pib-fake-news-samosa-jalebi-health-warning-cigarettes-media-news/,Fake claim: PIB calls out false media reports that union health ministry is set to issue health warning for samosa and jalebi like they...,"Many Indian media outlets, including Times of India and NDTV, recently published a news story alleging that popular Indian snacks and sweets such as samosa, jalebi and laddoo will be served alongside a health warning akin to those on cigarette packets. Furthermore, the new development was attributed to the Union Ministry of Health that it has been done in order to tackle health issues.

On 15th July, PIB fact-check, however, refuted the claims as false. It emphasized that the ministry’s advisory does not include any warning labels on food items sold by vendors and “has not been selective towards Indian snacks.”

Additionally, it clarified that the general recommendation is not unique to any one food product but rather serves as a “behavioural nudge” to alert consumers to “hidden fats and excess sugar in all food products.”

✅The general advisory is a behavioural nudge to make people aware of hidden fats and excess sugar in all food products, and not specifically to any particular food product.



The advisory is for healthier options and initiatives at workplaces and urges people to make healthier… pic.twitter.com/gD3f2XOeTF — PIB Fact Check (@PIBFactCheck) July 15, 2025

The agency added that the suggestion encourages “people to make healthier” decisions to reduce unnecessary sugar and oil in favour of a healthy diet and way of life as well as supports healthier workplace options and activities. “It does not target India’s rich street food culture,” it further pointed out.

What is in the letter

The ministry’s official letter identified “sharp rise in obesity in both children and adults” as a significant concern. It informed, “As per NFHS-5 (2019-21), over one in five adults in urban areas are overweight or obese. Prevalence of childhood obesity is impacted by poor dietary habits and reduced physical activity.”

It added, “As per The Lancet GBD 2021 obesity forecasting study, published in 2025, the number of overweight and obese adults in India is projected to rise from 18 crores in 2021 to 44.9 crores by 2050, making it the country with the second-highest global burden.” It stated that obesity dramatically increases the risk of non-communicable diseases like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease and several types of cancer.

The ministry pointed out, “It also affects mental health, mobility, and quality of life, and imposes a heavy economic burden through increased healthcare costs and productivity losses. Early prevention and health promotion are critical to reversing these trends.”

The letter outlined that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made a strong case for changing people’s lifestyles in order to fight obesity. “At the Opening Ceremony of the 38th National Games in Dehradun on 28th January 2025, Hon’ble Prime Minister invoked the Fit India Campaign and urged citizens to adopt active, healthy lifestyles as part of the broader vision of a Swasth Bharat. In his Mann Ki Baat, he called for a 10% reduction in oil consumption,” the official communiqué read.

It then conveyed, “In response to this national appeal, and as part of the ministry’s flagship initiatives under the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases (NP-NCD), it is imperative to promote sustainable behavioural changes in our workplaces. These include reducing excessive consumption of oil and sugar, both of which are key contributors to rising rates of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and other lifestyle-related disorders.”

According to the letter, it is advocating that Sugar and Oil Boards be displayed as an effort to encourage better eating practices in multiple settings. They will function as visual behavioural cues in public spaces like offices and schools, revealing important details including hidden sugars and fats in common food items.

Hence, a direction to all “departments/offices/autonomous bodies and other public institutions/organizations” under the ministry was sought.

Quoting INCLEN International Executive Director and proposed lead analyst N.K.

It added that “this larger study will analyse the trend of such deaths in an attempt to determine the risk factors for such mortalities”.

However, the Print news article was fact-checked by the PIB, which termed the claims made in it as fake.

Claims linking sudden deaths to COVID vaccine

Several claims linking sudden deaths caused by heart attack to the COVID-19 vaccine have been spreading across social media for years. However, the central government debunked all these claims earlier this month, on the grounds of two extensive studies conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research(ICMR) and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences. The studies found that there was no direct link between sudden deaths by heart attack and the COVID-19 vaccines.

Besides, studies by the ICMR and National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) affirmed that COVID-19 vaccines in India are safe and effective, with extremely rare instances of serious side effects. Sudden deaths due to heart attacks can be linked to a wide range of factors, including genetics, lifestyle, pre-existing conditions, and post-COVID complications.

To understand the causes of sudden, unexplained deaths, especially in young adults between the ages of 18 and 45 years, the ICMR and the NCDC conducted a study across 47 tertiary care hospitals in 19 states and UTs. Another study conducted by AIIMS with ICMR funding also examined cases of sudden cardiac deaths and found genetic mutations, pre-existing conditions, and lifestyle as the primary causes of these deaths and no correlation with Covid-19 vaccination.",medium portal print recently seen spreading fake news purported study conducted central government analyse pattern “to assess pattern sudden deaths” india covid 19 pandemic print published news article july 8 2025 claimed health research department dhr union ministry health collaborating inclen international clinical epidemiology network international new delhi based health research organisation conduct national community level study examine rise death among people 45 year age screenshot news article published print quoting inclen international executive director proposed lead analyst n k arora print claimed “the new nationwide assessment aim document sudden death community level across states” added “this larger study analyse trend death attempt determine risk factor mortalities” however print news article fact checked pib termed claim made fake news report theprintindia claimed centre commissioned nationwide study assess pattern sudden death india pibfactcheck ❌ claim fake ✅ nationwide survey commissioned centre department health… pic twitter com gpsrc1hz1c — pib fact check pibfactcheck july 9 2025 pib posted x “in news report theprintindia claimed centre commissioned nationwide study assess pattern sudden death india nationwide survey commissioned centre depthealthres dhr ” claim linking sudden death covid vaccine several claim linking sudden death caused heart attack covid 19 vaccine spreading across social medium year however central government debunked claim earlier month ground two extensive study conducted indian council medical research icmr india institute medical science study found direct link sudden death heart attack covid 19 vaccine besides study icmr national centre disease control ncdc affirmed covid 19 vaccine india safe effective extremely rare instance serious side effect sudden death due heart attack linked wide range factor including genetics lifestyle pre existing condition post covid complication understand cause sudden unexplained death especially young adult age 18 45 year icmr ncdc conducted study across 47 tertiary care hospital 19 state ut another study conducted aiims icmr funding also examined case sudden cardiac death found genetic mutation pre existing condition lifestyle primary cause death correlation covid 19 vaccination

The book has a chapter titled “Reshaping India’s Political Map”, which covers Indian history between the 13th and the 17th century, including the rise and fall of the Delhi Sultanate and the resistance to it, the Vijayanagar Empire, the Mughal Empire, and the resistance faced by them, and the rise of the Sikhs.

At the beginning of the book comes is a note for students, which gives them a contextual understanding of the inclusion of some dark historical episodes like the Islamic fundamentalism in the book and the approach to be adopted while studying them. “History sometimes seems to be full of wars and destruction… Should we omit them entirely? … The best approach is to face them and analyse them so as to understand what made such developments possible and, hopefully, help avoid their recurrence in future. It is important to study those darker developments dispassionately, without blaming anyone living today for them… The past continues to live with us and shapes the present.”

To be introduced in schools from the 2025-26 academic year, the book attempts to provide a complete picture of historical events or periods included in it by retaining their negative as well as positive aspects. While the book mentions how Mughal rulers Jahangir and Shah Jahan patronised art and architecture, it also highlights the brutalities of Babur, who massacred the entire populations of cities. It describes Aurangzeb as a military ruler who banned un-Islamic practices and reimposed taxes on non-Muslims and defines the rule of Mughal ruler Akbar, the left-liberal coterie’s poster boy of the Mughal period, as a “blend of brutality and tolerance”.

But the left liberals, who are habitual of using history as a tool to further their agenda, have a problem with it. They have a problem because the facade built by leftist historians who downplayed and whitewashed the brutalities of Islamic invaders and justified their atrocities against Hindus is crumbling. For a long time, they pushed a false narrative by portraying Mughal King Akbar as the epitome of religious tolerance. They eulogised him for abolishing the Jizya tax, a religious tax levied by Muslim rulers on Hindus and other non-Muslims for merely existing in an Islamic regime, but cleverly omitted to mention how he waged Jihad against Hindus during the seige of Chittorgarh and ordered the massacre of 30,000 Hindus populace.

The seige of Chittoragarh

By 1567, Mughal ruler Akbar had managed to get most parts of northern India under his control. Now, he was eyeing the Kingdom of Mewar, which was being ruled by the Suryavanshi Sisodia Rajput dynasty at that time, under Rana Udai Singh II. The Mewar kingdom stood as a symbol of resistance against the Mughal Empire, which had subdued most of the surrounding kingdoms. Akbar decided to launch a military expedition to besiege the Mewar capital at Chittorgarh and termed it as ‘Jihad’ against the infidels (Hindus).

Chittorgarh, situated in present-day Rajasthan, was a formidable fort spanning across 700 acres, situated atop 180 a high hill in the heart of the Mewar Kingdom. The fortress had survived the sieges by Aluddin Khilji (1303) and Bahadur Shah of Gujarat (1535).

Refusing to bow down before the Mughal emperor, Rana Udai Singh II geared up to defend his kingdom. In October 1567, Akbar marched from Agra with his army of 40,000 men equipped with cannons, muskets and siege equipment, aiming to bring the Mewar Kingdom to its knees. Inside the Chittorgarh fort was an army of 8000 Rajput warriors prepared to defend their pride. On the advice of his counsels, Rana Udai Singh II moved to his principality in the Aravali hills and left the Rajput army under the command of Jaimal Rathore.

The Mughal army strategically set up their camp at the base of the Chittorgarh hill to cut off supplies to the fort. The siege began, and both armies soon engaged in a full-fledged battle with arrows, musket shots and cannon shots flying across the sky. The Mughal army was struggling to penetrate the 30-feet-thick walls of the Chittorgarh fort. The Mughal soldiers made several strategies to breach the mighty walls of the Chittorgarh fort. They tried to stealthily march towards the base of the fort through covered trenches and dig burrows under the foundation of the fort and pack gunpowder in them to blow up the fort’s base. However, the Rajput armies were watching them. They dug counter-mines and resisted the Mughal armies, which suffered heavy losses.

The battle went on for months, till the fateful day when the Rajput commander Jaimal Rathore fell. There are varied accounts of the cause of Jaimal Rathore’s death. Some accounts say that he died from a musket shot fired by Akbar on February 22, 1568. Other accounts mention that Rathore was killed by Mughal marksmen. Jaimal Rathore’s death was a turning point in the battle, as the Rajput armies were demoralised and the Mughal armies were able to breach the fort. As soon as the fort was breached by the Mughal armies, the Rajput women inside the fort performed jauhar to protect their honour from the enemy. The remaining Rajput soldiers put up a final resistance before the Mughal armies and laid down their lives, before the fort was finally captured on February 23-24, 1568.

Some Mughal sources say that the Rajput armies of about 8000-10,000 men were entirely killed. Mughal king Akbar, who was frustrated and enraged by the stiff resistance put up by the Rajput armies, proclaimed the siege of Chittorgarh and the victory of Islam over infidels and ordered the massacre of the entire civilian population of around 30,000 people. The men were killed, and several women and children were enslaved.

But, according to left-liberals, Mughal King Akbar was a liberal and tolerant ruler, who abolished the Jizya tax, and not a cruel, intolerant tyrant who ordered the slaughter of thousands of innocent, unarmed Hindu civilians of the Chittorgarh fort, who posed no harm to him. This special ability to see one truth by ignoring the other truth is peculiar to the left-liberals. The only acceptable truth to them is their version of truth, no matter how incomplete, selective or even untrue it is.

This unique quality of theirs begs the question, Jo cheez jaisi hai usey vaisa usey vaisa he pesh kyo na kiya jaye, taat ko resham kyo kaha jaye?

It has been revealed that humans lived in that are around 4,000 years ago. Scientists who were searching for additional information about the captivating location in the Raichur district made the discovery. A collaborative team of 20 researches from India, Canada and the United States worked together to learn more about the area’s past.

Researchers have been excavating around Mallikarjun Hill, close to the Mallikarjuna Temple and the town’s Anjaneya Swamy temple. They have come across a variety of artefacts and other tools that date back four millennia which suggests that the area was once a vibrant settlement.

Professor Dr Andrew M. Bauer of Stanford University in the United States, Dr. Peter G. Johansen of McGill University in Canada and Hemanth Kadambi of Shiv Nadar University in Delhi-NCR (National Capital Region) alongside their team of over 20 researchers have been seeking evidence of human habitation and civilisation in Maski for the past three months.

They approached Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) for approval and afterward the crew began exploring Maski. The scientists identified 271 places of interest in the area and began their work. They unearthed evidence that the area surrounding the temple and Mallikarjun Hill was occupied by people from the 11th to the 14th century BCE.

They located an array of antiquities, including cooking tools like earthen pots and pans. Kadambi declared, “We have found evidence that indicates that there was a human settlement in Maski around 4,000 years ago.”

Maski inscription

Notably, British gold mine engineer C. Beadon found the Maski inscription in 1915. The region made its place on the archaeological map when the inscription, which dates to the time of the Mauryan emperor Ashoka, came to light. It was etched onto a rock surface within a cave.

One of the earliest inscriptions from the Mauryan era, it prominently displays the emperor’s name and his title as “Devanampriya” (Beloved of the Gods). A long-standing disagreement about whether the legendary ruler was actually referred to by the title or not was resolved when the same was mentioned alongside his name. It was written in Brahmi script and in the Prakrit language, highlighting his adherence to non-violence.",remarkable archaeological finding drawn attention karnataka’s maski town revealed human lived around 4 000 year ago scientist searching additional information captivating location raichur district made discovery collaborative team 20 research india canada united state worked together learn area’s past researcher excavating around mallikarjun hill close mallikarjuna temple town’s anjaneya swamy temple come across variety artefact tool date back four millennium suggests area vibrant settlement professor dr andrew bauer stanford university united state dr peter g johansen mcgill university canada hemanth kadambi shiv nadar university delhi ncr national capital region alongside team 20 researcher seeking evidence human habitation civilisation maski past three month approached archaeological survey india asi approval afterward crew began exploring maski scientist identified 271 place interest area began work unearthed evidence area surrounding temple mallikarjun hill occupied people 11th 14th century bce located array antiquity including cooking tool like earthen pot pan kadambi declared “we found evidence indicates human settlement maski around 4 000 year ago ” maski inscription notably british gold mine engineer c beadon found maski inscription 1915 region made place archaeological map inscription date time mauryan emperor ashoka came light etched onto rock surface within cave one earliest inscription mauryan era prominently display emperor’s name title “devanampriya” beloved god long standing disagreement whether legendary ruler actually referred title resolved mentioned alongside name written brahmi script prakrit language highlighting adherence non violence

While the attack itself was disturbing, what sparked further indignation was how Irish mainstream media chose to report the incident.

Instead of unequivocally condemning the brutality, reports used language that cast doubt on the nature of the crime, referring to it as an “alleged assault” despite the visible and horrific injuries sustained by the victim. This minimisation of violence, which bore all the hallmarks of a racially motivated hate crime, was called out in strong terms by the Indian Ambassador to Ireland, Akhilesh Mishra.

Ambassador Akhilesh Mishra exposes media bias over assault against an Indian origin man

Ambassador Mishra’s comments came with images of news reports that chose to cast doubt over the victim’s trauma, a strategy not unfamiliar to those tracking media narratives targeting Hindus globally. In doing so, Mishra highlighted an uncomfortable truth: that certain Western media institutions would rather gaslight Indian victims than confront the racial or ideological motivations behind such hate crimes.

The incident: A false accusation, brutal assault, and media whitewashing

The Indian man, who had arrived in Ireland just three weeks earlier, was assaulted and partially stripped in public in Tallaght on Saturday evening, July 19. According to The Irish Times, a mob confronted the man and falsely accused him of acting inappropriately around children, claims that were later disseminated online as part of a digital witch-hunt.

Irish police (Gardaí) have since confirmed that no evidence exists to support the accusations, yet the man was violently attacked, left bleeding, and taken to Tallaght University Hospital with serious injuries. Gardaí are now investigating the case as a possible hate crime, and there is speculation that the attack was racially motivated.

Local councillor Baby Pereppadan (Fine Gael) visited the victim and said he remains in shock and is not taking visitors. “Small incidents like these are happening frequently in Tallaght,” he warned, urging stronger police deployment in the area.

Sinn Féin TD Seán Crowe condemned the mob action as “vile and utterly unacceptable.” “Anyone who thinks this sort of mindless, racist violence makes their community safer is lying and fooling no one. This is not the first such attack in our area but it has to be the last,” he said.

A pattern of dehumanisation: Global racism targeting Hindus

While people of colour, especially Africans and South-East Asians, have long faced discrimination in the West, the treatment meted out to Indians, and Hindus in particular, reveals a unique and consistent pattern of prejudice. Hindus are not just exoticised or mocked; they are systematically demonised, dehumanised, and often blamed for the crimes of their persecutors.

Nowhere is this more apparent than in the disturbing trends on social media platforms where Hindu identity, symbols, and customs are routinely mocked with impunity.

From derogatory “cow piss” jibes to offensive caricatures of Hindu deities, the Hinduphobia is not just a cultural issue; it is a civilisational struggle where polytheistic traditions and Sanatan values are targeted by both far-left ideologues and right-wing supremacists, particularly in the West.

One need only look at the case of Stew Peters, a self-styled “America First” commentator who in 2024 described Hindus as “dot-headed cockroaches,” falsely alleging that Indians smear cow dung on their faces. Or Laura Loomer, who launched a xenophobic tirade against Indian-American Sriram Krishnan following his appointment to a senior AI policy position at the White House, calling Indians “third-world invaders.”

The vitriol extended far beyond individuals. Hindu deities like Maa Kali and Lord Ganesha were called “supervillains,” “demonic,” and “unfit for a first-world Christian country.” These sentiments are not just isolated outbursts but part of a coordinated campaign to otherise and vilify the Hindu community, especially those living proudly and unapologetically in the diaspora.

And this bigotry is undergirded by latent racism against Indians, particularly Hindus, and it rises to the surface every now and then, in both physical and psychological form —from attacking them literally as witnessed in Dublin to more sophisticated forms of assault — Hindumisic conferences organised in western universities that serve to legitimise such racism and give way to its more dangerous siblings, bigotry and dehumanisation.

The “Dismantling Global Hindutva” Conference: Institutionalised hatred of Hindus

Perhaps the most blatant example of institutionalised Hinduphobia came in the form of the “Dismantling Global Hindutva” conference held in September 2021. Sponsored by over 60 academic departments from 45+ universities, primarily in the United States, the three-day event brought together some of the most vocal and virulent anti-Hindu activists in academia and media.

The speakers list read like a who’s who of Hindumisia, including Audrey Truschke, Anand Patwardhan, Nandini Sundar, and Neha Dixit, individuals known for drawing false equivalences between Hindutva and Nazism. Ironically, the event’s poster depicted an inverted hammer violently uprooting a saffron-clad RSS Swayamsevak, a visual metaphor for the organised dismantling of Hindu civilisational identity.

The hammer, disguised as a pencil, was meant to portray “academic critique,” but its Nazi-esque symbolism mirrored the Röhm Putsch imagery of Nazi propaganda, where ‘eliminating violent elements’ was used to justify political murders. In this case, the target wasn’t a rogue militia. It was a symbolic attack on Hindus who dare to be assertive about their culture and beliefs.

The points of discussion during the conference followed a classic Goebbelsian propaganda template: select a few emotive triggers, repeat them endlessly, and cast your enemies as the threat to civilisation. It’s a strategy that paves the way for dehumanisation and, eventually, justifies violence.

The RSS or other Hindu organisations targeted aren’t paramilitary thugs. They are groups that aid flood victims, rescue women from trafficking, or assist during pandemics, tasks most self-proclaimed ‘liberal saviours’ wouldn’t touch. So why label them “militant”?

Because self-defence, cultural reclamation, and Hindu unity threaten the ideological monopoly of Islamists, Marxists, and global evangelists.

Research reveals a disturbing surge in Hinduphobic slurs and hate speech across social media platforms

A comprehensive 2023 study by the Network Contagion Research Institute (NCRI) lends credence to Mishra’s concerns. The report, ‘Quantitative Methods for Investigating Anti-Hindu Disinformation’, found a sharp rise in derogatory and genocidal content targeting Hindus across platforms like 4Chan, Telegram, Gab, and Twitter. These include memes and slurs such as “pajeet”, a racial epithet used to mock and dehumanise Hindus, alongside visual propaganda depicting Hindu symbols like tilaks and saffron clothing being subjected to ISIS-style beheadings or Nazi-style executions. The analysis also showed that the usage of such coded hate terms surged dramatically around key geopolitical events involving India, indicating coordinated disinformation efforts.

Perhaps most alarmingly, the NCRI discovered that Iranian state-sponsored troll networks were deeply involved in disseminating Hinduphobic content, often under fake Pakistani identities. These accounts strategically amplified hashtags and tropes accusing Hindus of genocide, inflaming caste divisions, and misrepresenting communal incidents like the 2020 Delhi riots. The trolls pretended to be human rights activists while tagging major news outlets like CNN and MSNBC to internationalise their narrative. This manipulation of digital platforms for geopolitical ends shows that Hinduphobia is not merely social bigotry; it is being weaponised as a tool of hybrid warfare.

The incident in Dublin, therefore, is not just a case of individual victimisation, it is a symptom of a transnational campaign to dehumanise Hindus in both physical and ideological realms. The assault, followed by media whitewashing, echoes the same patterns identified in the NCRI report: digital dehumanisation leading to real-world violence. Mishra’s remarks, then, are not only a defence of one man’s dignity but a broader call to recognise and confront the systemic erasure of Hindu identity under the guise of liberal tolerance.

From Anti-CAA protests to Digital pogroms

The dehumanisation of Hindus gained major momentum during the anti-CAA protests in India. Posters morphed the sacred Om into Nazi swastikas, women wearing bindis were portrayed as oppressors, and slogans like “Hinduon se Azadi” (Freedom from Hindus) echoed across protest sites. The song “Jab sab but tod diye jaayenge, bas Allah ka naam rahega” (“When all idols are broken, only Allah’s name shall remain”) was not fringe. It was mainstream. And it was celebrated.

This same contempt now fuels the global narrative, where being a proud Hindu in the West is considered an act of aggression, and where Indian immigrants are seen not as contributors, but cultural contaminants.

Are Hindus “invading” the West?

Contrary to the far-right and leftist narrative, Hindus aren’t flooding Western countries. As per Pew Research (2024):

Hindus make up only 5% of the global migrant population. Though 94% of Hindus live in India, only 57% of global Hindu migrants are from India. In contrast, Christians form 47% and Muslims 29% of global migrants.

The “Hindu invasion” is a myth, an imaginary construct, a bogeyman to manufacture hate.

From Dublin to Dismantling Hindutva: A global war on Hindus?

The Dublin assault and its casual dismissal by mainstream media is more than just a reporting failure. It is a symptom of a larger disease — a civilisational bias against Hindus that spans continents, cultures, and ideologies.

From hate crimes on the streets of Ireland and America to academic witch hunts like Dismantling Global Hindutva, Hindus today are not just being targeted physically, but also intellectually, politically, and spiritually.

Ambassador Akhilesh Mishra’s tweet is not just a diplomatic protest; it is a call to wake up. To recognise that being Hindu, wearing saffron, reciting shlokas, or simply existing unapologetically, is enough to be branded a target.

The question is no longer whether Hindus are being demonised. The question is: How long will we pretend that it’s not happening?

How online hatred fuels real-world attacks on Indians and Hindus

The Tallaght assault is a chilling reminder that online hate doesn’t just remain on the internet, it metastasizes into real-world violence.

In this case, false accusations against the Indian victim were first circulated online, accusing him of inappropriate behaviour near children. These baseless claims spread like wildfire on local WhatsApp groups and Facebook pages, ultimately emboldening a mob to hunt him down, strip him, beat him, and leave him bleeding on the street.

OpIndia,17/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/syrian-govt-led-by-former-isis-terrorist-ahmed-al-sharaa-unleashes-brutal-crackdown-on-druze-community-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-sweida-violence/,Syrian govt led by former ISIS terrorist Ahmed al-Sharaa unleashes brutal crackdown on Druze community: All you need to know about the Sweida violence,"What began as a localised tribal scuffle in southern Syria has now snowballed into a full-blown humanitarian and geopolitical crisis, with Israel attacking Damascus to stop its persecution of the Druze. The Druze-majority province of Sweida, long considered a relatively stable enclave in a strife-torn country, has plumbed into chaos after violent clashes erupted between Druze self-defence militias and armed Sunni Bedouin tribes.

The Syrian government’s decision to intervene, ostensibly to restore order, has instead drawn fierce criticism, with eyewitnesses and human rights observers accusing Damascus of using the unrest as a pretext to carry out a brutal crackdown on the Druze community.

As the conflict spirals, disturbing reports have emerged of field executions, looting, and arson carried out by state forces and their allies. The violence has laid bare the fragile nature of Syria’s post-Assad political transition, with interim president Ahmed al-Sharaa, himself a former jihadist commander, struggling to maintain legitimacy among minority groups.

What was once framed as a peacekeeping operation is now seen by many Druze as a calculated campaign of ethnic and sectarian cleansing, pushing the region toward open rebellion and international intervention.

Syrian officials have faced allegations of conducting summary executions of civilians in the Druze-dominated Sweida. Damascus sent troops to the region after Druze fighters and Sunni Bedouin tribes clashed, which killed several people, including women and children. Afterwards, the country’s defence minister Murhaf Abu Qasra declared a ceasefire in the city on 15th July as government forces arrived in the morning.

The “notables and dignitaries” of the city had reached an agreement, he stated and added that government forces would “respond only to the sources of fire and deal with any targeting by outlaw groups.” Nonetheless, altercations were witnessed as did complaints of human right breaches by security personnel.

The locals accused government troops and their allies of tearing through Druze neighbourhoods. They informed AFP that the development had little impact on the ground. The interior ministry also admitted that the conflicts persisted into the evening.

On the same day, the United Kingdom-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights unveiled that 21 members of the minority group had been killed in and around the region by Syrian government forces and their aides.

According to the war monitor, the violence which broke out since early 13th July already claimed the lives of at least 248 people, comprising 92 Druze and 28 of them were civilians. The observatory previously highlighted that forces from the “defence and interior ministries carried out field executions of 12 (19 per some reports) civilians after storming the Radwan family guest house in the city of Sweida.”

It further mentioned that armed groups associated with the government were also accountable for the shooting of three siblings in the presence of their mother in Sweida province. Rayan Maarouf, the editor-in-chief of the Suwayda 24 news website revealed that security forces had been involved in “savage practices.”

He pointed out that there have been instances of brutal murders of civilians and expressed, “dozens of them, yet we do not possess accurate figures.” Suwayda 24 further informed that more than 200 people had been injured. Social media posts featured videos of armed combatants abusing Druze prisoners and shaving their beards.

The agency disclosed that the defence ministry employees took part in “systematic acts of vandalism targeting civilian homes and property” and “stealing the contents of homes, smashing doors and windows, and then setting fire to some of them” among other acts of crimes. Men in military outfits were observed robbing and burning houses as well as liquor stores.

The government troops entered the city with Bedouin fighters and accompanied them in attacking the Druze, according to the observatory, Druze leaders and witnesses. Gunfire and dead bodies laying on empty streets were reported by an AFP correspondent who landed in Sweida soon after the forces.

“Catastrophic” is how one Suweida local described the situation, adding that indiscriminate firing has caused residents to “flee towards the countryside” in spite of a curfew imposed by Syrian authorities, reported BBC Arabic.

Concern among the Druze increased when Islamist groups connected with the Syrian government joined the conflict leading a prominent member of the community to demand “international protection.” The majority of Druze religious leader also announced that they were in favour of the government’s deployment following the Bedouin violence.

However, they later called for armed resistance as the unrest escalated and voiced, “We are being subject to a total war of extermination,” and urged the Druze population “to confront this barbaric campaign with all means available.”

The authorities have been ordered to “take immediate legal action against anyone proven to have committed a transgression or abuse, regardless of their rank or position,” according to a statement released by former Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) commander and current interim president Ahmad al-Sharaa.

Tit-for-tat kidnappings and attacks between local Bedouin tribes and Druze armed forces in the southern province sparked bloodshed two days after a Druze businessman was kidnapped on the highway to Damascus. This marked the first deployment of Syrian government forces to Suweida since the Islamist-led rebels ousted President Bashar al-Assad in December.

Israel enters the conflict

Israel conveyed that after two days of deadly sectarian riots, it had targeted the government forces in the vicinity of Sweida as they moved into the largely Druze city. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu maintained that the government “intended to use (them) against the Druze.” Hence, he ordered strikes on forces and weapons in the area.

Israel with its own Druze population has promised to defend the members of the community who are living in Syria. It views any military deployment south of Damascus as a security hazard and has cautioned the Syrian government against the same. It vowed to continue the assault to protect the group.

On the other hand, the Syrian foreign ministry insisted that the strikes killed several civilians and members of the security forces, but failed to offer any exact numbers. The ministry denounced the Israeli attacks in a statement.

It termed them as “a reprehensible example of ongoing aggression and foreign interference in the internal affairs of sovereign states” and “a blatant violation of the sovereignty of the Syrian Arab Republic.”

Israel, nevertheless, complied with the Trump administration’s request to stop its strikes. The United States even deployed tanks to the troubled area. According to the country’s Syria envoy Tom Barrack, the US is communicating with all parties “to navigate towards calm and integration.”

The U.S. official claimed the Syrian government had informed Israel in advance that it was sending tanks to the Sweida area in southern Syria and stressed this was not an action directed at Israel but an attempt to restore order in internal clashes between Druze militias and a… https://t.co/a7SzPzx9AV — Barak Ravid (@BarakRavid) July 15, 2025

The recent camaraderie between Donald Trump and Ahmed al-Sharaa surprised many, as the former referred to the ex-Islamic terrorist as a “young, attractive and tough guy.” Washington even rescinded the $10 million bounty on his head and removed sanctions placed on Syria.

With the overthrow of Assad regime, the Jewish state has adopted a tough posture towards Syria’s new authorities, arguing it does not want terrorists along its borders. Israeli forces have executed hundreds of airstrikes on Syrian military targets and taken control of a United Nations-patrolled buffer zone on Syrian territory near the Golan Heights border.

Who are the minority Druze community

The majority of the nearly one million members of the Druze Arab sect reside in Syria, Lebanon and Israel. The group which originated in Egypt in the eleventh century, is an offshoot of Ismailism, branch of Shia Islam that forbids marriages and conversions to or from the faith.

The Druze are mostly found in three major provinces in the southern part of Syria, near the Israeli-ruled Golan Heights. They primarily reside in the Sweida province and a few Damascus suburbs, especially in Ashrafiyat Sahnaya and Jaramana to the south.

The Golan Heights, a strategically located plateau that Israel annexed in 1981 after capturing it from Syria during the 1967 Six-Day War is inhabited by around 20,000 Druze. There are about 25,000 Jews also staying in over 30 villages on the territory.

When Israel took over Golan, the majority of the Druze who identify as Syrian, turned down an offer of Israeli citizenship. Israeli residency cards were issued to those who declined although they are not regarded as the country’s citizens.

There is a Druze diaspora outside of the Middle East, especially in North America and Australia. Their population was expected to be over 700,000 until Syria’s civil conflict broke out in 2011. The Druze have been migrating to southern Syria since the 16th century, to what is now known as Jabal al-Druze or Druze Mountain in Sweida province, according to historian Sami Makarem’s book “The Druze Faith.”

During the ten-year civil war, the Druze who form the majority in the Suwayda region in southern Syria were pushed between the forces of the previous Assad administration and extremist organisations. Druze militias had retained a strong hold on Suweida, resisting appeals to join the security forces.

As the nation then took pride in its secular and Arab nationalist system, religious freedom was ensured under the strict control of the Assad family. Ahmed al-Sharaa also promised to safeguard them, however, his government is regarded with suspicion by them and other minorities.

The new 23-member Syrian cabinet unveiled in late March only featured one Druze member, Minister of Agriculture Amjad Badr, despite the transitional government’s commitment to incorporate minorities, including the Druze.

Earlier, many Druze citizens were slain including extrajudicially, as a result of sectarian warfare against their militias by Syrian transitional government armed forces and associated outfits that started on 28th April. Likewise, Christian and Alawite minority communities faced severe persecution few months after the new administration took charge.

Ahmed al-Sharaa’s ties to terrorism

The war name of Ahmed al-Sharaa was Abu Mohammad al-Jawlani. The United States classified him as a terrorist and the United Nations (UN) proscribed him. Over the past 20 years, he held significant positions in global terrorist organisations like Al Qaeda and ISIS. He was designated a global terrorist in 2013.

He collaborated closely with ISIS chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and Al Qaeda’s Aiman al-Zawahiri. He was instructed by the former to start a local outfit to provide a front for Al Qaeda Iraq and Syria during the 2011 uprising against the Assad regime. The Al-Nusrah Front also called Jabhat al-Nusrah or Jabhat Fatah al-Sham was founded by him in 2012.

This UN-designated terrorist group was officially acknowledged as the Syrian branch of Al Qaeda. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham or HTS became the new name for the Jabhat Fatah al-Sham in 2017. Its main objectives were to overthrow the Assad government and establish an Islamic Caliphate.

The group spearheaded a swift and widespread assault and seized areas which were under the Assad government. Afterward, retaliatory killings became rampant in Syria following Ahmed al-Sharaa’s takeover as his Sunni hardliner supporters and radicals targeted people from minority communities.

Therefore, while some Druze opposed Bashar al-Assad’s dictatorial government, they are also wary of Ahmed al-Sharaa, an Islamist leader with a history of perpetrating Islamic jihad. Reservations about some of their leaders being left out of his national discussion processes have been presented by them.",began localised tribal scuffle southern syria snowballed full blown

The first stages of the initiative, started in 2014, were headed by archaeologist K Amarnath Ramakrishna.

However, a significant political dispute between the Tamil Nadu government and the centre has unfolded by his repeated transfers and the Archaeological Survey of India’s (ASI) reservations about his excavation report.

K Amarnath is now appointed as the Director of the National Mission on Monuments and Antiquity (NMMA) in Greater Noida. He was employed as the Director of the National Mission on Monuments and Antiquity in New Delhi prior to the transfer, which occurred six months after his last assignment. He had previously spent three months in the position of Director for Excavation and Exploration.

K Amarnath was ordered to modify his report by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), however, he denied to comply, leading to a fierce war of words between the central and state governments.

How it all began: The Keeladi findings and its significance

Keeladi also known as Keezhadi is on the Vaigai river basin, situated in the Sivaganga district, approximately 12 kilometers southeast of Madurai. Excavations were started more than ten years ago at the Pallichanthai Tidal in Keeladi which was once a 100-acre coconut grove by Amarnath Ramakrishna, the ASI’s superintending archaeologist at the time. Keeladi stood out among the over 100 locations he had selected for excavation along the Vaigai River.

Over 7,500 ancient artefacts, such as wells, drainage systems and wall structures were discovered there, pointing to a thriving and advanced urban society. These materials were disclosed to be more than 2,160 years old, dating to the second century BCE (Before Common Era) which coincides with Tamil history’s Sangam period, according to carbon dating.

The ASI conducted the first three of the eight rounds of excavations. After the Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology (TNSDA) assumed responsibility for the project, the artefacts accumulated to over 18,000, which included pottery, inscribed potsherds, gold ornaments, copper articles, semi-precious stones, shell and ivory bangles, glass beads, spindle whorls, terracotta seals, and weaving tools.

The location produced more than 120 potsherds with Tamil Brahmi inscriptions. The discovery alongside thousand inscribed potsherds from other areas demonstrated the script’s continued existence in the region. Copper needles, clay seals, spinning whorls, yarn hanging stones, terracotta spheres, and earthen containers for liquids alluded to different stages of the weaving industry.

They also indicated that Keeladi was a strong, well-planned and sophisticated urban community with traces of businesses like beadmaking, dyeing and pottery. The artistic, culturally diverse and affluent lifestyle of the Keeladi people is reflected in gold decorations, copper objects, semi-precious stones, shell bangles, ivory bangles and ivory combs.

Beads made of carnelian and agate reflected importation through business networks. Furthermore, their recreational interests had been disclosed through the uncovering of terracotta and ivory dice, gamesmen and signs of hopscotch which also revealed the presence of an elite society. It was also unearthed that the area’s fertility and cow husbandry were key factors in its development, opening the door for the locals to engage in sea trading and produce an abundance of rice.

The results showcased a far older and more developed civilisation than previously believed, pushing the Sangam Age in Tamil Nadu back to about 800 BCE, as per reports. The Sangam Age, also known as the Tamil Sangam period, is a significant period in the history of South India. It was named for the Sangam, an assembly of Tamil poets and academics, saw a flourishing of literature and culture in southern India. It was generally accepted to have occurred between approximately 300 BCE and 300 CE (Common Era).

The Keeladi objects displayed certain symbols that were similar to those of the Indus Valley Civilization. However, there is cultural separation of roughly 1,000 years and scholars anticipated that more research would shed light on this relationship.

Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology asserted that Keeladi possessed all the hallmarks of an urban civilisation, including brick buildings, upscale goods and evidence of both domestic and international trade. It presented itself as a highly developed and hard-working civilisation and provided proof of Tamil Nadu’s urban life and settlements throughout the Early Historic Period. Additionally, Keeladi only strengthened Sangam Literature’s legitimacy.

Strong structures orientated in cardinal directions unveiled systematic urban planning and pot fragments with Tamil Brahmi inscriptions confirmed a literate culture. The sun and moon graffiti revealed the people’s astronomical awareness.

Keeladi was an urban town from the Sangam era and the cultural deposits discovered during the fourth phase of excavations could be easily dated to a time between the sixth and first centuries BCE, according to a 2019 report from the Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology. One of the six samples sent to the United States for carbon testing was dated 580 BCE. It was taken at a depth of 353 centimetres.

Notably, according to the findings presented in the report, the Keeladi artefacts date back approximately 300 years earlier than the previously believed 3rd century BCE.

Ramakrishna’s discovery and subsequent transfer

Keeladi was found by Amarnath Ramakrishna, who supervised the first two seasons of excavations from 2014 to 2016 and handed over a 982-page report to ASI Director General V. Vidyavathi. The report’s twelve chapters provided an explanation of the excavation’s goals and historical context.

The 23 samples that were dated using Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) at the Beta Analytical Lab in Florida of the United States were covered in a different chapter. It also incorporated research on floral and faunal remains from the site to arrive at the period, as well as discoveries from other universities, as per reports.

The first two phases of excavation at Keeladi yielded about 5,800 artefacts after which Ramakrishna was transferred to Assam. The action was reportedly viewed as a setback to the effort. The centre was accused by critics of purposefully sabotaging the excavations because it had committed to release funds and support for additional digging, but postponed both.

Meanwhile, the excavations had already progressed into their third phase under archaeologist PS Sriraman. Interestingly, Sriraman announced that there was no continuity in the brick constructions that had been found earlier, after 400 square meters of excavation. As a result, claims emerged from Tamil Nadu that the centre was actively ‘downplaying’ Keeladi’s prominence, aided by the usual political narratives of anti-North India sentiments that is seen in Tamil political discourse.

TN Govt took up excavation project after ASI stopped, found 13,000 more items

The ASI halted excavations at the site, arguing that the third phase produced no significant outcomes. However, the work was taken over by the Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology in 2017 and thousands of artefacts have since been unearthed. The ninth phase of the excavations was launched by Chief Minister MK Stalin in April 2023 and ended in September of the same year.

The Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology has been able to uncover more than 13,000 items and acquire radiocarbon dates from 580 BCE to 200 CE. The excavations, entered their tenth phase by 2024-2025 and already produced hundreds of antiques.

Furthermore, a 30-foot-long new structure has recently been found at the third trench of the Keeladi excavation after ASI ruled out the possibility of any noteworthy discovery at the site. The bricks used in this new structure are identical in design and make to those used in other parts.

“The bricks used in this new structure are identical in design and make to those used in other parts of Keeladi, strengthening the authenticity of the findings. Earlier studies by Amarnath Ramakrishna’s team had already suggested the area might have housed industrial zones,” V Marappan, Professor of History at Presidency College, outlined while talking to The Federal.

He added, “These new findings raise questions about whether other sections of the site remain unexcavated underground.” The new structure, east-west orientated was discovered 90 centimetres below the surface on the western side. Its length is estimated to be approximately 10 meters. According to archaeologists, it might have been an industrial building or a workshop.

Madras High Court intervenes

The matter made its way to the judiciary in the interim. Judges from the Madras High Court intervened and travelled to the excavation site. They asked the ASI to carry on with the excavations and permit the involvement of the Tamil Nadu Department of Archaeology. The archaeology department of the state followed the instruction.

It had been working on it since the third phase of excavation, giving a more dramatic turn to the events. The court’s Madurai bench in 2019 pronounced that the excavations should not stop since significant advancements in Tamil civilisation had been uncovered while considering a number of petitions that sought an order to the state and the centre to preserve the archaeological sites in Tamil Nadu.

The public would learn more about Tamil civilisation through the archaeological excavations, thus Division Bench consisting of Justices D. Krishnakumar and R. Vijayakumar advised the relevant authorities to ensure that they were carried out without any obstacles.

The court even ordered the centre to send back Amarnath Ramakrishna to Tamil Nadu within 15 days to continue the excavations. Amarnath Ramakrishna, who had been moved back to the state, put forth his report on the first two stages of excavation in January 2023.

Last year, the High Court even sent a notice to the centre demanding the ASI to release the report that was provided following the first two stages of the excavations. The centre received notice regarding the petition filed by Madurai resident P. Prabhakar Pandian from the bench.

The state and the centre were also instructed to submit more counter-affidavits to several public interest litigation petitions concerning the excavations, in the same year. It ordered the authorities to present the rebuttal affidavits to the 2016 and 2017 petitions which had asked the relevant authorities for guidance on how to proceed with the excavations at Keeladi rather than shutting down the site.

One of the petitions asked the government to establish a “site museum” at Keeladi. Stalin opened a Rs 18.43 crore Keeladi museum in March 2023 on two acres.

The Madurai bench even granted the Archaeological Survey India’s request to relocate the artefacts from the excavation to its Dehradun lab for further scientific analysis, in 2016. It was instructed to notify the state’s archaeology commissioner prior to the move. The commissioner was told to record videos and take pictures of the items. The ASI was given directions to return the objects to Tamil Nadu and provide a report to the court.

Controversy erupts between the Centre, Tamil Nadu govt

The 982-page final report was given by Ramakrishna in January 2023, following preliminary and interim submissions in 2016 and 2017, respectively. It had been with the ASI for almost two and a half years and it wrote to Ramakrishna in May seeking a revision.

The Archaeological Survey of India raised concerns regarding the dating and profoundity of specific outcomes. It underscored that the evidence for the earliest period seemed to be quite early and stated that it needed further examination.

According to the letter, “the three periods require proper nomenclatures or re-orientation.” It remarked that the “8th century BCE to 5th century BCE for Period I requires concrete justification.” It also noted that “just mentioning depth for the available scientific dates is not enough but the layer number should also be marked for comparative consistency analysis.” The ASI also demanded that the manner in which dates were presented should also be amended.

However, Amarnath Ramakrishna refused to modify his results, maintaining that his research was sound from a scientific standpoint and supported by strict archaeological standards. He maintained that material culture, stratigraphic sequences and even Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) corroborated the report’s chronology.

A number of Tamil Nadu political groups, including the ruling-Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), the Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi and historian R. Balakrishnan, denounced the ASI’s move as an attempt to stifle Tamil culture. They accused that the failure to recognise Keeladi’s importance was motivated by politics.

On the other hand, Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, the Union Minister for Culture, stated that additional scientific research was necessary to validate Ramakrishnan’s conclusions because they lacked technical support. He asserted that a single finding could not alter the entire discourse and therefore, more data, outcomes and proofs were needed to be collected.

Shekhawat stated that Tamil Nadu is a vital part of India and that its history should be honoured using knowledge based on science rather than polarising opinions. He informed Stalin that the union government would not hesitate to publish any reports and would be delighted to support the state if the research was validated by science.

The union minister declared that more convincing evidence is required for the report to be accepted by the scientific community. He even questioned was the Tamil Nadu government had been reluctant to work with the centre on this matter due to which the conflict has persisted.

“People holding such positions are trying to use that to grow regional sentiments. That is not fair. We have to be very cautious. Let archaeologists, historians, and technical experts discuss this, instead of politicians,” he mentioned.

However, Thangam Thennarasu, Tamil Nadu’s Archaeology Minister, charged that the union government treats Tamils as second-class citizens. He complained, “They also refused to allocate funds for the excavations and allowed the report to gather dust for two years. Now they say there is no adequate evidence. Every time they reject Tamil history, only the method of rejection changes.”

Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam’s (MDMK) Vaiko also claimed that the centre was attempting to promote “a non-existent Sanskrit civilisation” while repressing Tamil civilisation.

“How many obstacles do Tamils face? We have been fighting against all of them for thousands of years, and with the help of science, we have been establishing the antiquity of our race. Yet some minds refuse to accept it. It’s not the statements that need to be corrected, it’s some minds,” MK Stalin recently shared on social media last month while reacting on Ramakrishna’s recent transfer.

Communist Party of India (Marxist) MP from Madurai S Venkatesan expressed, “Transferring an official is not in itself a major issue, it is part of administrative procedures. But Amarnath Ramakrishna worked on the Keeladi excavation for eight years, without compromising on the truth. He was removed, reassigned and denied the opportunity to publish his findings. Only after court intervention was he allowed to write the report.”

He conveyed that the ASI had promised the court and Parliament that the report would be released in 11 months, but that deadline had not been fulfilled while the centre now wants more scientific proof at the final stage. “The message is clear: If you do not align with our views, this is what will be done to you. This is not just about an individual, it’s a discriminatory act against Tamil Nadu and against South Indian history itself,” he alleged.

The AIADMK (All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam) which was in power when the Keeladi report was issued, did not comment on the dispute for a long time. On 18th June, however, its senior leader and former minister RB Udhayakumar stated that the union government had requested further data in order to provide “additional corroboration.” He added that his party would be the first one to voice its disapproval if the Keeladi report was rejected.

Stalin accused the party of remaining silent while the centre minimised the importance of the location to which Udhayakumar retorted that his party’s government had approved Rs 55 lakh for the 2018 excavations. Mafoi Pandiarajan, a senior AIADMK leader who helmed archaeology under Edappadi Palaniswamy, praised him as “Keeladi Nayakar” (hero of Keeladi) and gave him credit for proving Tamil antiquity. A veteran DMK leader retaliated, “Their belated pride in Keeladi rings hollow when they put alliance politics above Tamil identity.”

Central government demands excavation report

The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has asked retired superintending archaeologist PS Sriraman to present the official excavation report for the third phase of the Keeladi excavations. He handled the short-lived third phase in 2017 after Ramakrishna’s abrupt transfer and reported that no major discoveries were made.

He retired in 2019 and has been given permission by the agency to write reports on the excavations he supervised in Keeladi, where he headed the third phase of excavations. He was also involved in the work for one season at Kodumanal which is situated on the northern banks of the Noyyal River in the Erode district, between 2017-2018.

According to archaeologists, Kodumanal could be split into two cultural periods: the Megalithic era and the Prehistoric era. During these times, the locals built durable structures, were skilled craftspeople and engaged in trade with several nations.

Sriraman would be writing the report from the ASI office in Chennai. He talked to The Hindu and revealed, “As I had retired, both reports were pending. I sought the approval of the ASI to access the material and prepare the reports. Since all the related materials are in Chennai, I will begin preparing the reports soon.”

He reiterated, “I have sought permission to complete the report since I am retired now. A formal communication from the ASI is expected soon,” while speaking with Deccan Herald. “The ASI instructed me to complete as quickly as possible. I am concentrating more on Kodumanal because it is an individual work – my work while the third phase in Keezhadi is for a shorter period and it was a continuation of work done earlier,” he asserted in conversation with The New Indian Express.

This comes more than a month after Ramakrishna was asked by the ASI to “resubmit” his report following the necessary changes recommended by two experts who reviewed it.

New dawn in India’s history: Traces of parallel civilization

The Keeladi site has unveiled a pivotal chapter in the history of Tamil Nadu. The indication that an artifact belonged to the 6th century BCE by the US laboratory Beta Analytics holds a major significance. They used the method of radiocarbon dating and suggested that it was contemporary with the urbanisation of the Gangetic plains.

The oldest of the 29 radiocarbon samples dated by the Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology since the 2017-18 excavation season was 580 BCE and the most recent was 200 CE. The results indicated that between the sixth century BCE and the second century CE, there was a vibrant urban and industrial civilisation that lasted for 800 years.

Large brick buildings from the Sangam Age had been discovered and provided proof of the development discussed in Sangam literature. Archaeologist K Rajan who is advisor to Tamil Nadu’s archaeology department voiced, “Most samples above the brick structures date to after the 3rd century BCE, while those below go as far back as the 6th century BCE,” reported The Times of India.

With the use of 3D technology and anthropometric measurements from a skull discovered at the Kondagai burial site, archaeologists are one step closer to unveiling the face of the ancient Tamil people who inhabited the Keeladi settlement thousands of years ago. Rajan stated, “Based on the skull, we will reconstruct the age, dietary pattern, determine the gender, and actual face of the person.”

He added, “This places Keeladi alongside the urbanisation of the Gangetic plains, India’s second urbanisation. Of the 29 radiocarbon dates, 12 fall in the pre-Ashokan era, before the 3rd century BCE.”

Over 20 research institutions from India and abroad are working with the state archaeology department to recreate life in Keeladi in 580 BCE. These involve Liverpool University in the United Kingdom, the University of Pisa in Italy, the Field Museum in Chicago, the French Institute of Pondicherry, IIT Gandhinagar and Deccan College.

Animal bones discovered in Keeladi are under examination at the Deccan College. The bones of bulls, buffaloes, goats, cows, sheep, dogs, pigs, antelope and spotted deer were located during excavations. Researchers at Madurai Kamaraj University are looking into ancient animal and human DNA in order to gain further insight into the mixing and human migration of the ancient residents of Keeladi and Kondagai, a Keeladi cluster hamlet.

A single site has produced 29 dates applying this scientific method. “It shows Keeladi was an urban settlement with a literate society and a community of artisans. It was an industrial hub along an ancient trade route linking the east coast port of Alagankulam to Muziris on the west coast via Madurai,” mentioned R Sivanandam, joint director of state archaeology department.

However, the settlement’s original name is still unknown. Towns, streets, palace structures, decorations, gemstones and international trade are part of Sangam literature. “Keeladi has proved that Sangam literature was a lived experience of ancient Tamils and not imaginative stories,” conveyed indologist R Balakrishnan.

At the site, archaeologists uncovered rectangular and cubic pieces of clay and ivory dice that, according to Balakrishnan, are referenced in “Kalithogai” the sixth of the eight anthologies of Sangam literature.

Rajan emphasised, “Keeladi isn’t the only site with roots in the 6th century BCE. Kodumanal, Porunthal, Sivagalai, Adichanallur and Korkai have also yielded dates from that period. Korkai has produced a date as early as 785 BCE, suggesting Sangam-age urbanisation was widespread.”

Only 4% of the 110 acres of cultural deposit at Keeladi have been unearthed by researchers in ten seasons of excavation. The state government intends to execute further excavations and has established a museum to display the discoveries. There are also plans for an on-site museum which will be the first of its sort in the country.

“Tamil Nadu has endured archaeological apathy for far too long until Keeladi sparked a wave of interest among Tamils,” complained Balakrishnan. Rajan expressed, “Keeladi is the first site that transformed the understanding of archaeology in Tamil Nadu.”

Faces from Keeladi

Meanwhile, a first-of-its-kind forensic facial reconstruction project coordinated by experts from Madurai Kamaraj University and Liverpool John Moores University restored the faces of two individuals who lived in the Keeladi region more than 2,500 years ago. Researchers described the facial features as South Indian with signs of ancient Austro-Asiatic people and West Eurasian (Iranian) hunter-gatherers.

The skulls were discovered around 800 meters from the main excavation site at Kondagai, a burial site. They added that more DNA research is required to identify the genetic ancestry.

Professor Caroline Wilkinson, director of Face Lab at Liverpool John Moores University informed, “We used a computer-assisted 3D facial reconstruction system to rebuild the facial musculature and estimate facial features following anatomical and anthropometrical standards. . As the lower jaws of the skulls were missing, we used orthodontic standards to estimate the shapes of the mandibles from cranial measurements and planes,” according to a report in The Times of India.

According to professor G Kumaresan of Madurai Kamaraj University’s genetics department which scanned and sent pictures of the skulls to Liverpool, “It is 80% science and 20% art.” He outlined that the DNA information and the recreated faces could be useful in determining the lineage of Tamils who lived during the Sangam era.

Critical moment in India’s civilisational journey

The 90-by-60-meter excavated area contains artefacts like as dice, unidentified copper coins, glass, shell, ivory, pearl, and terracotta beads, seals and gold decorations. More importantly, it is one of the few locations in Tamil Nadu, along with Arikamedu, Kaveripattinam and Korkai, to produce a broad range of structures, including intricate brick constructions, tank-like drainage systems, double-walled furnaces and terracotta ring wells.

All of this not only indicates a vibrant, literate and successful urbanized community but also emphasizes the advanced nature of Indian civilization. Its origins trace back to the timeline of the Gangetic plains which also illuminate how India has been home to not just one but multiple prime civilizations and flourishing communities residing in both the northern and southern regions of this vast country for many centuries. Furthermore, the discoveries indicated that they were also linked to the external world.

Such developments not only reinforce the deep civilizational roots of this ancient country but also aid in comprehending the elements of our age-old society. The myths surrounding foreigners who landed in the country and established their communities are also debunked by these revelations, which confirm that the nation has been the cradle of multiple ancient advanced settlements displaying city planning, trade, leisure and all indications of a vibrant cultural society.

These discoveries are therefore not merely a matter of pride but are crucial in preserving our civilizational foundations, comprehending and sustaining a continuous connection with our past, as well as understanding our background. Certainly, the sophisticated perspective of our forebears and the societies they formed and preserved over centuries is truly a subject of admiration.

Intellectuals, historians, epigraphists, geologists and archaeology aficionados have all been drawn to Keeladi to analyse the historical relevance it provides to society and it has even prompted several research investigations.

Police opened fire, resulting in one person dying and the other getting seriously injured.

According to the sources, the clash erupted when a large group of Muslims who illegally occupied the government land attacked the eviction team. Eyewitness accounts and video footage from the scene show Muslim residents pelting stones at the eviction team and attacking an excavator used in the operation. In an act of self-defence, police opened fire upon the mob. One person died and the other sustained injuries. At least 10 from the team of forest and police personnel have also been injured, officials said.

The eviction was part of the state government’s initiative to reclaim over 140 hectares of encroached land within the Paikan Reserve Forest. The encroached areas include the densely populated areas of Bidyapara and Betbari, where 1,080 families of East Pakistan/Bangladesh-origin Muslim immigrants have reportedly been living for years without valid land documents.

Meanwhile, Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma has issued a stern warning, saying, “Once the eviction is completed, we plan to undertake afforestation in the cleared areas. Anyone attacking police personnel will face legal consequences.

However, nearly three years later, the ambitious project seems to have failed to find any acceptance among the students.

Not a single MBBS student from the Hindi-medium MBBS course in the state has appeared for the exam in Hindi, according to a Dainik Bhaskar report. The government have spent Rs 10 crore on printing medical textbooks in Hindi. The initiative that was intended to benefit students from Hindi medium backgrounds has failed to make any significant impact.

Students from various medical colleges told Dainik Bhaskar that they prefer studying and writing exams in English. The reasons are largely tied to better career prospects and the standard practices within the medical profession.

A social media user asked whether the 10 crores would have been better utilised in improving college and hostel infrastructure.

The project to teach MBBS in Hindi in Madhya Pradesh has failed miserably.

The government spent ₹10 crore of taxpayers’ money on printing medical textbooks in Hindi, yet not a single student attempted their exams in the language.



This money could have been better utilized to… pic.twitter.com/nU0wIlPgVS — यमराज (@autopsy_surgeon) July 17, 2025

Dr. Aruna Kumar, Dean of Gandhi Medical College, Bhopal, stated that teaching methods have not significantly changed since the introduction of the Hindi curriculum. Although teachers are encouraged to use Hindi language to communicate during lectures, English remains the dominant language for reading and writing for medicos. From July 12, medical college admissions for the new academic year will begin.

What students faced?

The Bhaskar report quoted Ankit Pandey, from Sidhi district, who joined a government medical college in 2022 after completing Class 12 and NEET in Hindi. Initially apprehensive about studying in English, Ankit was relieved to find Hindi textbooks and teachers communicating in Hindi during lectures. However, he soon discovered that lecture slides and reference material were in English.

“When I started reading, I realised the Hindi textbooks were just transliteration, all the medical terms were still in English, simply written in Hindi script,” he says. Eventually, he shifted to English textbooks entirely and has written all his exams in English over the past three years.

In another case, Muskan Prajapati, a third-year student at Gandhi Medical College, explains that the Hindi and English textbooks are nearly similar. “They haven’t translated the medical terms. ‘Liver’ is still written as ‘liver,’ not ‘yakrit’; ‘limb’ is still ‘limb,’” she says. She adds that medical terminology is so embedded in English that they refer to Hindi books only when something in the English version isn’t clear. All notes and exams are in English, which they find more convenient.

The registrar of Madhya Pradesh Medical Science University confirmed that all government medical colleges in the state now offer MBBS in Hindi. When asked how many students had written their exams in Hindi over the last three years, he said, “Not a single one.” Despite the availability of Hindi textbooks and bilingual question papers, students prefer English.

He also noted that, until now, students weren’t even given an option to choose the exam language in application forms. English was the default language. Even when the Hindi curriculum was launched, there was no formal provision for language choice. While students were allowed to write in either Hindi or English, they consistently chose English.

Government incentive plan for choosing Hindi

To promote the use of Hindi, the Madhya Pradesh government has announced a 50% discount on examination fees for students opting to write exams in Hindi. The average MBBS exam fee in government colleges is ₹6,000. Additionally, those who rank high in graduation or post-graduation will receive cash rewards. Madhya Pradesh is the first state in India to offer such incentives to promote Hindi in medical education.

Challenges on Hindi language implication

On July 2, members of the Parliamentary Committee on Official Language visited Gandhi Medical College to assess the challenges of implementing the Hindi MBBS curriculum. Committee convener and MP Ujjwal Singh Raman told Dainik Bhaskar that they were evaluating whether this model could be replicated in other states. “We found that students from Hindi medium backgrounds do use these books, but English-medium students show little interest. Only 10–15% of MBBS seats are filled by Hindi medium students,” he said.

When asked whether Hindi could be introduced at the postgraduate and research levels, he replied that the current focus is solely on the MBBS program. Introducing Hindi in PG and research will be a gradual process.

Despite the government’s push for Hindi in medical education, students continue to rely heavily on English for study and exams. The gap between the intent of inclusivity and the practical demands of the medical profession suggests that language reform in technical education requires more than just transliterated textbooks. More importantly, the intent behind such experiments with taxpayer money has to be based on actual demand and necessity of students, not mere righteous opinions of individuals or headline chasing.

Previous experiment to offer Engineering courses in Hindi has also failed

This isn’t an isolated case of the government attempting to push Hindi in professional education as a student friendly policy, and students rejecting it. Madhya Pradesh first introduced Hindi in engineering education. However, similar feedback has emerged, students showed little interest in pursuing engineering courses in Hindi.

At Maulana Azad National Institute of Technology (MANIT), Bhopal, only a handful of students opted to study engineering in Hindi. MANIT Director Professor K.K. Shukla stated that students are generally not inclined toward engineering in Hindi.

In the 2022-23 academic session, 1,200 students were admitted to engineering courses at MANIT, of which just 150 chose the Hindi medium. However, many of them either dropped out or left the institute. After a year into the 4-year course, just 27 students were left in Hindi medium, a report by NavBharat Times found.

In the next session, only 89 students enrolled for the Hindi-medium courses in BTech Engineering and Diploma.

Are these policies rooted in practicality?

Even though political leaders claim that offering professional courses in Hindi will “help” students, the reality tells a different story. These appear more like appeasement experiments rather than initiatives aligned with the actual academic and career needs of students.

The core issue lies in the mismatch between policy and practicality.

OpIndia,17/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/labour-government-in-uk-set-to-reduce-voting-age-from-18-to-16/,UK: Labour government plans to lower the voting age from 18 to 16 ahead of the next general elections,"In a major electoral change, the UK government is set to reduce the voting age from 18 to 16 by the next general election. The Labour government announced the decision to alter the voting age on Thursday (17th July).

Justifying his government’s decision, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that many 16 and 17-year-olds work and pay taxes, and therefore, they should have a say in how their tax money is spent.

UK Lowers Voting Age to 16



PM Keir Starmer announces voting age will drop from 18 to 16 for all UK elections



Says 16-year-olds earn, pay taxes, and deserve a voice in democracy pic.twitter.com/grN81EAkQ7 — Nabila Jamal (@nabilajamal_) July 17, 2025

“Today, we’re delivering on our promise to give 16 and 17-year-olds the right to vote. Young people already contribute to society by working, paying taxes and serving in the military. It’s only right that they can have a say on the issues that affect them,” UK’s Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner wrote on X.

Today we’re delivering on our promise to give 16 and 17 year olds the right to vote.



Young people already contribute to society by working, paying taxes and serving in the military. It's only right they can have a say on the issues that affect them. #VotesAt16 — Angela Rayner (@AngelaRayner) July 17, 2025

The decision will lower the voting age across the UK to 16. Scotland and Wales have already lowered the voting age for local-level elections. With the decision, the Labour Party government will be fulfilling a promise in the Labour Manifesto. Once the voting age is lowered to 16, the UK will join the league of countries like Austria, Brazil, and Scotland, which allow their respective citizens aged 16 and above to vote in the national and local elections.The UK government is also reportedly taking steps towards automatic voter registration to reduce the need to repeatedly fill out voter details across different government services.

“For too long, public trust in our democracy has been damaged and faith in our institutions has been allowed to decline. We are taking action to break down barriers to participation that will ensure more people have the opportunity to engage in UK democracy, supporting our plan for change, and delivering on our manifesto commitment to give 16-year-olds the right to vote,” Rayner said. “We cannot take our democracy for granted, and by protecting our elections from abuse and boosting participation, we will strengthen the foundations of our society for the future,” she added.

The government will also tighten its noose around foreign money being used to influence elections in the UK. It aims to crack down on shell companies and illegitimate political donations. Before receiving donations from companies, Political parties will have to assess them against a series of tests to prove their connection to the UK or Ireland. The companies will be required to prove that they are generating income in these countries. In case of any violation of rules, including false or misleading declarations, hefty fines up to £500,000 will be imposed.

As per the existing rules, any UK company can make political donations regardless of when it was established, where it earns money, or who its owners are. This will no longer be the case. The Election Commission will guide on how the assessment of these companies will be done. The government is also planning to protect election candidates against intimidation, harassment and abuse by eliminating the requirement to publish their home addresses on their election material. Those found intimidating or abusing a candidate will be barred from contesting elections in future.

Many other countries, including Nicaragua, Isle of Man, Guernsey, Ethiopia, Ecuador, and Cuba allow their citizens aged 16 and above to vote in elections. Similarly, in Sudan, South Sudan, North Korea, Indonesia, Greece, and East Timor, the voting age is 17 and above. In Indonesia, a citizen is allowed to vote at 17 but a married individual is allowed to vote regardless of age.",major electoral change uk government set reduce voting age 18 16 next general election labour government announced decision alter voting age thursday 17th july justifying government’s decision uk prime minister keir starmer said many 16 17 year old work pay tax therefore say tax money spent breaking uk lower voting age 16 pm keir starmer announces voting age drop 18 16 uk election say 16 year old earn pay tax deserve voice democracy pic twitter com grn81eakq7 — nabila jamal nabilajamal july 17 2025 “today we’re delivering promise give 16 17 year old right vote young people already contribute society working paying tax serving military it’s right say issue affect ” uk’s deputy prime minister angela rayner wrote x today we’re delivering promise give 16 17 year old right vote young people already contribute society working paying tax serving military right say issue affect votesat16 — angela rayner angelarayner july 17 2025 decision lower voting age across uk 16 scotland wale already lowered voting age local level election decision labour party government fulfilling promise labour manifesto voting age lowered 16 uk join league country like austria brazil scotland allow respective citizen aged 16 vote national local election uk government also reportedly taking step towards automatic voter registration reduce need repeatedly fill voter detail across different government service “for long public trust democracy damaged faith institution allowed decline taking action break barrier participation ensure people opportunity engage uk democracy supporting plan change delivering manifesto commitment give 16 year old right vote ” rayner said “we cannot take democracy granted protecting election abuse boosting participation strengthen foundation society future ” added government also tighten noose around foreign money used influence election uk aim crack shell company illegitimate political donation receiving donation company political party assess series test prove connection uk ireland company required prove generating income country case violation rule including false misleading declaration hefty fine £500 000 imposed per existing rule uk company make political donation regardless established earns money owner longer case election commission guide assessment company done government also planning protect election candidate intimidation harassment abuse eliminating requirement publish home address election material found intimidating abusing candidate barred contesting election future many country including nicaragua isle man guernsey ethiopia ecuador cuba allow citizen aged 16 vote election similarly sudan south sudan north korea indonesia greece east timor voting age 17 indonesia citizen allowed vote 17 married individual allowed vote regardless age

How Awami League is rebuilding itself and fighting the Islamist regime of Muhammad Yunus,"It has been 11 months since the Awami League government in Bangladesh was toppled through a well-coordinated regime change operation. The undemocratic ouster of Sheikh Hasina and her eventual escape to India meant that party leaders were left to fend for themselves against the systematic persecution by Islamists under the watch of ‘chief advisor’ Muhammad Yunus.

Numerous Awami League politicians and supporters alike were killed and tortured by violent mobs. The party was disenfranchised while its associate student and youth wings were disbanded. The Yunus regime curbed the political activities of the Awami League in the garb of ‘fighting fascism.’

Attempts were made to erase the existence of the political party and its contribution to the freedom movement of Bangladesh. As such, the future of the Awami League appeared dark and bleak. With no strong leader in its midst, worsened by popular discontentment, the story of the Sheikh Hasina-led party was written off completely.

Despite all the pessimism, the Awami League supporters are gradually rebuilding the party in the absence of Sheikh Hasina. They are taking to the streets, without fear for their safety and security, to challenge the Yunus regime and its puppets in the political arena.

Awami League supporters take NCP Islamists head-on

Such an act of resistance was on display when Awami League supporters challenged Islamists belonging to the National Citizen Party (NCP) – a political outfit comprising radicals who orchestrated the fall of Sheikh Hasina.

The incident occurred on Wednesday (16th July) in Gopalganj in the Dhaka Division of Bangladesh. Awami League supporters protested against the NCP during their ‘March to Rebuild the Nation’ programme.

Armed with sticks, they chased the Islamists who toppled the democratic Sheikh Hasina government in August 2024. The Awami League supporters chanted the slogan of ‘Joy Bangla’ and stormed the site of NCP rally.

Given that many members of the NCP served as ex-advisors to the interim government, Yunus quickly directed its security officials to curb the protests with an iron hand.

The police forces and Army officials initially fired tear gas shells and sound grenades, but later unleashed brutalities on Awami League supporters. According to media reports, Yunus’ security forces killed at least 4 protesters. A curfew was also imposed in the area.

Gopalganj is home to the mausoleum of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the Founding Father of Bangladesh. Sheikh Hasina had contested several elections in the past from this constituency.

Rattled by the protests of the Awami League supporters, the office of Muhammad Yunus stated, “This heinous act…will not go unpunished.”

Awami League rebuilding itself, with one protest at a time

In January 2025, supporters of the Awami League announced a 9-day roster of protests to bring an end to the undemocratic rule of Muhammad Yunus.

“People of Bangladesh do not want this interim government, which doesn’t have any constitutional validity, to be in power for even another day…. AL being a party of ordinary people of Bangladesh is organising the programmes to give voice to people’s concerns,” absconding Awami League leader A.F.M Bahauddin Nasim told The Telegraph

In February this year, Islamists masquerading as ‘student protestors’ launched attacks at the residence of Awami League leader Mozammel Haque in Bangladesh’s Gazipur. This prompted Awami League supporters to resist the attackers.

The Home Ministry of Bangladesh issued a statement, shrewdly labelling the clashes between the ‘student protestors’ and Awami League supporters as ‘terrorist attacks.’

Home Affairs Advisor Jahangir Alam Chowdhury declared, “Those who attempt to destabilise the country will be arrested.” The repeated dehumanisation and attempts to portray the Awami League as an ‘enemy of Bangladesh’ were soon followed by mass arrests.

How Muhammad Yunus oversaw persecution of the Awami League

Soon after coming to power on 8th August 2024, Muhammad Yunus chalked out plans to ban the Awami League. The plan did not go through due to fierce opposition from rival political parties.

In October 2024, the interim government banned the Bangladesh Chhatra League, the student wing of the Awami League, over supposed violence committed by its members since 2008.

In January this year, Yunus regime introduced new textbooks for primary and secondary students which falsely claim that the first declaration of independence of Bangladesh was made by Ziaur Rehman, the founder of BNP, and not Mujibur Rehman.

The ‘Nobel laureate’ has made it clear that he is willing to go to any length to distort the country’s history and erase the contribution of the Awami League in the Independence Movement.

The ‘student protestors’, who oversaw the ouster of Sheikh Hasina, had launched ‘Bulldozer procession’ outside the residence of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rehman in February this year. They carried out vandalism and set the building on fire.

The radical elements, who enjoy the backing of the Yunus regime, also damaged murals of the founding Father of the Nation. They also carried out destruction and arson attacks on the residences of Sheikh Hasina’s late husband and cousins.

The ‘student protestors’ also attacked the homes of ex-President Abdul Hamid and former Bangladeshi army chief Moeen U. Ahmed. Far from condemning the vandalism, Yunus appeared to justify the actions. This explains why no ‘student protestor’ has been arrested.

He has also remained tight-lipped on attacks on Awami League leaders and the destruction of the party office.

The advisors to Muhammad Yunus such as Mahfuz Alam and Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyain had called for the disbanding of Awami League earlier this year.

Mahfuz Alam had announced, “The elections will be contested among pro-Bangladesh groups only.” He defined pro-Bangladesh groups as BNP, Jamaat-e-Islami etc and said that these parties would form a government through ‘fair electoral process’

“But Awami League’s rehabilitation will not be allowed in this country,” he emphasised, indicating that there are no plans to let Awami League contest elections in a ‘democratic’ Bangladesh.

Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyain had also declared that Awami League should be ‘eradicated politically and ideologically’ from the Islamic Republic.

He claimed, “The Awami League should not only be banned but also politically eradicated from Bangladesh. This is my personal stance. Now, discussion may take place on how it will be implemented. There are precedents of this in various countries”

“I have seen my brothers martyred by their [AL men] firing before my eyes. I have been a victim of disappearance; I have seen death up close. It is impossible to even think of the political rehabilitation of Awami League,” Bhuyain brazened out.

Islamist Sarjis Alam, who is close to the Yunus regime and now part of the NCP, had also demanded a blanket ban on the Awami League.

“We cannot hold voters accountable for the crimes of the party. However, the registration of the Awami League as a political party must be completely revoked,” Alam had declared.

Around the same time, Muhammad Yunus launched a campaign to hunt down Awami League (AL) leaders from across the country. The nefarious mission has been dubbed ‘Operation Devil Hunt.’

As part of the political witch-hunt, as many as 12,000 Awami League supporters and activists were put behind bars. The centrally supervised campaign was executed by the police, Bangladesh Army, Navy, Air Force, Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB), Ansar and the Coast Guard.

In May this year, the Yunus regime finally banned the Awami League under the Anti-Terrorism Act, days after the NCP launched a march to ensure the disbanding of the political party.

In July 2025, Awami League leader Sheikh Hasina was sentenced in absentia to 6 months in prison for ‘contempt of court’ by the Yunus-controlled Bangladesh International Crimes Tribunal (ICT).

Conclusion

Muhammad Yunus was tasked to lead Bangladesh following the undemocratic ouster of former Prime Minister and Awami League supremo, Sheikh Hasina.

He was expected to take the Islamic Republic on the path of ‘democracy’ in the politically turbulent time.

However, the regime of the Nobel laureate is busy pandering to Islamists, ensuring the revival of the opposition BNP and crushing the Awami League with an iron fist as part of a well-thought-out political strategy.

As the first bus arrived in the Markanar village on Wednesday (16th July), villagers cheered and welcomed it by waving the national flag. This was the first time the villagers had seen a bus service arrive in the village in over 7 decades since independence. The bus service started by the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) will connect the area with the state transport network. According to a police release, about 1200 locals, including students, from Markanar and the nearby villages of Murumbhushi, Phulnar, Koparshi, Poyarkothi and Gundurwahi will benefit from the bus service. Next year, the bus service is expected to reach Murumbhushi.

“We were able to launch the MSRTC bus service after Markanar and the adjoining areas adopted the government’s ‘gaobandi’ scheme, banning entry of Maoists in return for development schemes. Commandos began reclaiming liberated zones and extended protection to road construction and the setting up of mobile phone towers. The rest is history now,” said SDPO Bhamragarh division Amar Mohite.

Mohite said that earlier, the MSRTC bus linked Aheri to Kothi via Bhamragarh, but now, after the construction of a road, the bus will travel another 5 km to Markanar. “Barely 800m are left to link remote Murumbhushi to Markanar. Security forces provided cover to labourers and equipment, but the rains halted work,” the SDPO said.

Markanar village is situated at the foothills of Abujhmad, a former Naxal stronghold, in Bhamragad subdivision of the Gadchiroli district. The bus service, which will run from Markanar to Aheri, is said to have become a reality with the efforts of the local police. The district has struggled with poor connectivity and transport for a long period of time due to the Maoist activities.

Central and State governments working to uproot left-wing terrorism

The central and state governments, along with the security forces, are making collaborative efforts to uproot naxalism and connect naxal-affected areas with the mainstream. Earlier this month, the Maharashtra government introduced a bill titled the Maharashtra Public Security Bill 2024 to curb the spread of the Maoist ideology in the state. While presenting the bill in the state assembly, Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis said that the Bill is meant to punish those who wish to overthrow the established institutions of the country. Explaining the reasons for the introduction of the Bill, Fadnavis said that the influence of the Maoist ideology is growing in the urban and rural areas of the state, particularly in districts like Gadchiroli and Konkan.

The central government had adopted a multipronged strategy to eliminate the menace of left-wing terrorism, including aggressive military operations and development efforts. The government has also been working towards strengthening security as well as civil infrastructure in the Naxal-affected areas by setting up security camps and enabling development projects.

Last year in January, the central government launched ‘Operation Kagar’ to completely eradicate the left-wing terrorism in Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra (Gadchiroli), Odisha, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and Telangana. Under the operation, around 1 lakh para-military troops, including the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), its elite CoBRA units, District Reserve Guards DRG), and state police, equipped with modern technology, have been deployed in the left-wing terrorism affected areas to completely uproot the naxal terrorism from its last remaining strongholds. The security forces have been successful in eliminating the top leadership of the Naxal cadres under the operation, pushing the left-wing terrorism to the verge of extinction.",marking significant feat restoration normalcy markanar village gadchiroli district maharashtra naxal affected area state run bus service village commenced first time since independence first bus arrived markanar village wednesday 16th july villager cheered welcomed waving national flag first time villager seen bus service arrive village 7 decade since independence bus service started maharashtra state road transport corporation msrtc connect area state transport network according police release 1200 local including student markanar nearby village murumbhushi phulnar koparshi poyarkothi gundurwahi benefit bus service next year bus service expected reach murumbhushi “we able launch msrtc bus service markanar adjoining area adopted government’s ‘gaobandi’ scheme banning entry maoist return development scheme commando began reclaiming liberated zone extended protection road construction setting mobile phone tower rest history ” said sdpo bhamragarh division amar mohite mohite said earlier msrtc bus linked aheri kothi via bhamragarh construction road bus travel another 5 km markanar “barely 800m left link remote murumbhushi markanar security force provided cover labourer equipment rain halted work ” sdpo said markanar village situated foothill abujhmad former naxal stronghold bhamragad subdivision gadchiroli district bus service run markanar aheri said become reality effort local police district struggled poor connectivity transport long period time due maoist activity central state government working uproot left wing terrorism central state government along security force making collaborative effort uproot naxalism connect naxal affected area mainstream earlier month maharashtra government introduced bill titled maharashtra public security bill 2024 curb spread maoist ideology state presenting bill state assembly maharashtra cm devendra fadnavis said bill meant punish wish overthrow established institution country explaining reason introduction bill fadnavis said influence maoist ideology growing urban rural area state particularly district like gadchiroli konkan central government adopted multipronged strategy eliminate menace left wing terrorism including aggressive military operation development effort government also working towards strengthening security well civil infrastructure naxal affected area setting security camp enabling development project last year january central government launched ‘operation kagar’ completely eradicate left wing terrorism chhattisgarh maharashtra gadchiroli odisha jharkhand madhya pradesh telangana operation around 1 lakh para military troop including central reserve police force crpf elite cobra unit district reserve guard drg state police equipped modern technology deployed left wing terrorism affected area completely uproot naxal terrorism last remaining stronghold security force successful eliminating top leadership naxal cadre operation pushing left wing terrorism verge extinction

He befriended her while concealing his true name and religion and attempted to lure her out of Kota. The accused identified as 25-year-old Razak, masqueraded as Adi. He is originally from Uttar Pradesh.

He has been arrested and the matter is being viewed as an incident of “love jihad.” The offender formed a friendship with the student on social media and attempted to lure her out of Kota through deception. While en route, she grew suspicious and successfully saved herself.

The girl then proceeded immediately to the police station. The cops detained him and brought him to Kota, after obtaining information. She was presented before the Child Welfare Committee. The members counselled her and then handed her over to her family. Child Welfare Committee Chairman Rajendra Singh Rathore stated that the underage girl believed the lies of the perpetrator who introduced himself as Adi on Instagram and tricked her.

Rathore added that the culprit travelled to Kota to meet her and then persuaded her to leave with him. According to him, the former broke her SIM card to ensure that no one could track them down. Nevertheless, she became wary of him when he was speaking to someone at his home. She noticed that the language he used sounded different and suspected he was a Muslim.

The Bandh has been called to protest the self-immolation death of Soumyashree Bishi, a 20-year-old student at Fakir Mohan Autonomous College in Balasore. The political firestorm ignited by the tragedy intensified with revelations that Congress’ student wing orchestrated online harassment campaigns against the victim, even as senior party leaders positioned themselves as champions of justice.

The crime branch takes command of the investigation

On Wednesday, 16th July, the Odisha police handed over the case to the Crime Against Women and Children Wing (CAW&CW). DSP Iman Kalyan Nayak has been appointed as the chief investigating officer. He is very well known for handling sensitive cases. He will be supported by Inspector Panchali Rout. The team will function with the powers of the Officer-in-Charge of Sahadev Khunta Police Station, where the case was originally registered.

This investigation focuses on the charges under Section 75(1)(iii) for sexual harassment, Section 78 for Stalking, Section 108 for abetment to suicide and Section 351(2) for criminal intimidation of Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita.

Authorities confirmed the probe will re-examine evidence and witness statements while scrutinizing the role of college authorities. “There is sufficient evidence against the two (Principal Dillip Ghosh and HoD Samir Kumar Sahoo) to prove abetment of suicide,” a senior police officer revealed.

A desperate final act

On 12th July, Soumyashree’s ordeal reached its peak when she set herself on fire outside Principal Ghosh’s chamber. CCTV footage obtained by police shows that the victim entering Ghosh’s office crying, staying for approximately 30 minutes, and emerging weeping before her final act. Minutes earlier, she had reportedly called a friend, revealing the principal was pressuring her to withdraw her sexual harassment complaint against HoD Samira Kumar Sahoo.

As per the friend, earlier the principal had asked for more timem, but did nothing even after 7–8. “In fact, he warned the victim of consequences if she failed to prove her complaint,” the friend said.

That friend said that she was trolled by juniors, who called her a “bad girl” on social media and campus and assassinated her character. “On June 30, us friends accompanied her for support. She had gone to the principal earlier too, but wasn’t heard. On June 30, we all went with her to demand action. The principal asked for 7-8 days but did nothing. The HoD instigated students to defame her.”

On 14th July, despite emergency treatment at AIIMS Bhubaneswar, Soumyashree succumbed to her injuries due to 95% burn injuries. Her death certificate listed the immediate cause as “septicemic shock” resulting from extensive burns, but the underlying causes traced back to alleged institutional betrayal.

Statewide Bandh demands accountability

A statewide Bandh was called in Odisha on Thursday, 17th July, led by the Congress party with the support of Left factions and other opposition parties. Shops remained shut and traffic was disrupted in many areas, including Bhadrak and Mayurbhanj. In Bhadrak, markets were closed and public transport was affected. Over 200 police platoons were deployed statewide to maintain order.

Protesters brandishing placards with Soumyashree’s image blocked highways and staged rail roko demonstrations. They demanded the r⁠esignation of the Education Minister, local MLA, and MP, Immediate termination of accused college officials, and a Judicial probe into institutional failures. OPCC President Bhakta Charan Das framed the bandh as moral rather than political: “Every school, college, and university is at risk if we don’t act now”.

Hypocracy of Congress’ in its peak

Once again hypocrisy of the Congress party has emerged when their leaders marched in protest. Rahul Gandhi spoke with Soumyashree’s father, calling the incident “a wound to the entire society” and blaming the “BJP’s system” for her death. But it has been revealed that members of the Congress students wing NSUI themselves were harassing the girl.

As per the victim’s friend who talked to media, Soumyashree was used as a political tool by opposition student union NSUI.

Documents and social media archives reveal that the National Students’ Union of India (NSUI), the student wing of the Congress party, launched a malicious online defamation campaign against her when she was alive. NSUI-affiliated accounts circulated posts branding Soumyashree as “Unstable and manipulative” for political gains, engaged in an “affair with the Education Minister for favours”, ⁠fabricating allegations to “gain sympathy marks”.

NSUI member Ajay Kumar Panda made a vile post claiming that Soumyashree has a transactional relationship with a senior minister. This post went viral, shattering Soumyashree’s morale and will, isolating her socially and psychologically. Taking to X, BJP spokesperson Sanju Verma shared pictures of Sourav Behera, an NSUI worker and Rahul Gandhi fan, calling him an accused in the 20-year-old girl’s self-immolation. Verma suggested that the deceased victim was associated with the BJP’s student wing ABVP and claimed that the victim was being harassed by Behera.

An Investigation was conducted by ABVP (BJP’s student wing) which shows images of the accused HoD, Dr. Sahu, dining comfortably with NSUI leaders.

Meanwhile, CPI(M) leader Suresh Panigrahi demanded judicial intervention, saying, “The victim appealed to everyone from local MLA to Education Minister… nothing happened”.

Family’s anguish amid digital persecution

Speaking to India today, Soumyashree’s father broke down, he said, “She did this after coming out of principal’s room. Something must have happened. I was not there…My daughter was forced to die. They should all be charged.”

Soumyashree’s brother filed a formal complaint at Bhograi Police Station, citing continued cyber-harassment even after her death. He stated, “People are making derogatory remarks and posting filthy posts… In our bad times, we are being made to bear this unnecessary trolling”.

According to reports, the victim worked as a receptionist at a local gym named Sai Fitness Gym, where the accused Aman Khan worked as a trainer.

As per the Station-in-charge Praveen Kumre, the victim said that Aman Khan used to inappropriately touch her and hurl abuses. Khan also used to force her to convert to Islam, and explain the ‘benefits’ of converting to Islam.

When she refused to convert, Aman Khan threatened that her that he would make her quit her job. She said that several women who worked in her position in the past had to quit because of Aman’s harassment.

The victim said that she complained about Aman’s behaviour to the gym owner earlier, but nothing happened. Thereafter, the victim approached the members of the Hindu Tiger Force, who accompanied her to the police station, where she filed a complaint.

The members of the organisation surrounded the police station and demanded swift action against the culprit. Subsequently, the police reached the gym to arrest Aman Khan, but he had fled by the time they arrived.

Police kept searching for him at several places, including his residence, but he was not found. Later on, on receiving the information that the accused had gone to the gym to take his things, the police reached the gym and nabbed him there.

The accused has been sent to judicial custody. A case under the relevant provisions of the Madhya Pradesh Freedom of Religion Act, and section 75 of the BNS has been filed against the accused.

Mukesh Rajak, a member of the Hindu Tiger Force, said Aman Khan used to hide his identity and pose as ‘Aman Raj’ before the women who used to come to the gym for training.

Sanjana Vishwakarma, a member of the Hindu Tiger Force, said that for a long time, the organisation has been receiving complaints about women being touched inappropriately while training at the gym.

“The Aam Aadmi Party has looted the future of Dalit children by seizing power in the name of Dalits. They have insulted Babasaheb’s ideals and tainted the sacred field of education with their corrupt policies”, Rekha Gupta wrote on ‘X’.

The Druze-majority province of Sweida, long considered a relatively stable enclave in a strife-torn country, has plumbed into chaos after violent clashes erupted between Druze self-defence militias and armed Sunni Bedouin tribes.

The Syrian government’s decision to intervene, ostensibly to restore order, has instead drawn fierce criticism, with eyewitnesses and human rights observers accusing Damascus of using the unrest as a pretext to carry out a brutal crackdown on the Druze community.

As the conflict spirals, disturbing reports have emerged of field executions, looting, and arson carried out by state forces and their allies. The violence has laid bare the fragile nature of Syria’s post-Assad political transition, with interim president Ahmed al-Sharaa, himself a former jihadist commander, struggling to maintain legitimacy among minority groups.

What was once framed as a peacekeeping operation is now seen by many Druze as a calculated campaign of ethnic and sectarian cleansing, pushing the region toward open rebellion and international intervention.

Syrian officials have faced allegations of conducting summary executions of civilians in the Druze-dominated Sweida. Damascus sent troops to the region after Druze fighters and Sunni Bedouin tribes clashed, which killed several people, including women and children. Afterwards, the country’s defence minister Murhaf Abu Qasra declared a ceasefire in the city on 15th July as government forces arrived in the morning.

The “notables and dignitaries” of the city had reached an agreement, he stated and added that government forces would “respond only to the sources of fire and deal with any targeting by outlaw groups.” Nonetheless, altercations were witnessed as did complaints of human right breaches by security personnel.

The locals accused government troops and their allies of tearing through Druze neighbourhoods. They informed AFP that the development had little impact on the ground. The interior ministry also admitted that the conflicts persisted into the evening.

On the same day, the United Kingdom-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights unveiled that 21 members of the minority group had been killed in and around the region by Syrian government forces and their aides.

More clashes reported between pro-government forces and Druze communities in Syria’s Sweida Governorate pic.twitter.com/vRPaKxxlik — RT (@RT_com) July 16, 2025

According to the war monitor, the violence which broke out since early 13th July already claimed the lives of at least 248 people, comprising 92 Druze and 28 of them were civilians. The observatory previously highlighted that forces from the “defence and interior ministries carried out field executions of 12 (19 per some reports) civilians after storming the Radwan family guest house in the city of Sweida.”

It further mentioned that armed groups associated with the government were also accountable for the shooting of three siblings in the presence of their mother in Sweida province. Rayan Maarouf, the editor-in-chief of the Suwayda 24 news website revealed that security forces had been involved in “savage practices.”

He pointed out that there have been instances of brutal murders of civilians and expressed, “dozens of them, yet we do not possess accurate figures.” Suwayda 24 further informed that more than 200 people had been injured. Social media posts featured videos of armed combatants abusing Druze prisoners and shaving their beards.

🚨 Horrifying video from As-Suwayda, a Druze-majority city in southern Syria:

They’re in full military police gear.



It echoes Nazi tactics: humiliating Jews by shaving beards. State-led ethnic abuse… pic.twitter.com/8cNdkq7vB8 — Sacha Roytman (@SachaRoytman) July 15, 2025

The agency disclosed that the defence ministry employees took part in “systematic acts of vandalism targeting civilian homes and property” and “stealing the contents of homes, smashing doors and windows, and then setting fire to some of them” among other acts of crimes. Men in military outfits were observed robbing and burning houses as well as liquor stores.

The government troops entered the city with Bedouin fighters and accompanied them in attacking the Druze, according to the observatory, Druze leaders and witnesses. Gunfire and dead bodies laying on empty streets were reported by an AFP correspondent who landed in Sweida soon after the forces.

“Catastrophic” is how one Suweida local described the situation, adding that indiscriminate firing has caused residents to “flee towards the countryside” in spite of a curfew imposed by Syrian authorities, reported BBC Arabic.

Concern among the Druze increased when Islamist groups connected with the Syrian government joined the conflict leading a prominent member of the community to demand “international protection.” The majority of Druze religious leader also announced that they were in favour of the government’s deployment following the Bedouin violence.

However, they later called for armed resistance as the unrest escalated and voiced, “We are being subject to a total war of extermination,” and urged the Druze population “to confront this barbaric campaign with all means available.”

The authorities have been ordered to “take immediate legal action against anyone proven to have committed a transgression or abuse, regardless of their rank or position,” according to a statement released by former Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) commander and current interim president Ahmad al-Sharaa.

Tit-for-tat kidnappings and attacks between local Bedouin tribes and Druze armed forces in the southern province sparked bloodshed two days after a Druze businessman was kidnapped on the highway to Damascus. This marked the first deployment of Syrian government forces to Suweida since the Islamist-led rebels ousted President Bashar al-Assad in December.

Israel enters the conflict

Israel conveyed that after two days of deadly sectarian riots, it had targeted the government forces in the vicinity of Sweida as they moved into the largely Druze city. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu maintained that the government “intended to use (them) against the Druze.” Hence, he ordered strikes on forces and weapons in the area.

Israel with its own Druze population has promised to defend the members of the community who are living in Syria. It views any military deployment south of Damascus as a security hazard and has cautioned the Syrian government against the same. It vowed to continue the assault to protect the group.

On the other hand, the Syrian foreign ministry insisted that the strikes killed several civilians and members of the security forces, but failed to offer any exact numbers. The ministry denounced the Israeli attacks in a statement.

It termed them as “a reprehensible example of ongoing aggression and foreign interference in the internal affairs of sovereign states” and “a blatant violation of the sovereignty of the Syrian Arab Republic.”

Israel, nevertheless, complied with the Trump administration’s request to stop its strikes. The United States even deployed tanks to the troubled area. According to the country’s Syria envoy Tom Barrack, the US is communicating with all parties “to navigate towards calm and integration.”

The U.S. official claimed the Syrian government had informed Israel in advance that it was sending tanks to the Sweida area in southern Syria and stressed this was not an action directed at Israel but an attempt to restore order in internal clashes between Druze militias and a… https://t.co/a7SzPzx9AV — Barak Ravid (@BarakRavid) July 15, 2025

The recent camaraderie between Donald Trump and Ahmed al-Sharaa surprised many, as the former referred to the ex-Islamic terrorist as a “young, attractive and tough guy.” Washington even rescinded the $10 million bounty on his head and removed sanctions placed on Syria.

With the overthrow of Assad regime, the Jewish state has adopted a tough posture towards Syria’s new authorities, arguing it does not want terrorists along its borders. Israeli forces have executed hundreds of airstrikes on Syrian military targets and taken control of a United Nations-patrolled buffer zone on Syrian territory near the Golan Heights border.

Who are the minority Druze community

The majority of the nearly one million members of the Druze Arab sect reside in Syria, Lebanon and Israel. The group which originated in Egypt in the eleventh century, is an offshoot of Ismailism, branch of Shia Islam that forbids marriages and conversions to or from the faith.

The Druze are mostly found in three major provinces in the southern part of Syria, near the Israeli-ruled Golan Heights. They primarily reside in the Sweida province and a few Damascus suburbs, especially in Ashrafiyat Sahnaya and Jaramana to the south.

The Golan Heights, a strategically located plateau that Israel annexed in 1981 after capturing it from Syria during the 1967 Six-Day War is inhabited by around 20,000 Druze. There are about 25,000 Jews also staying in over 30 villages on the territory.

When Israel took over Golan, the majority of the Druze who identify as Syrian, turned down an offer of Israeli citizenship. Israeli residency cards were issued to those who declined although they are not regarded as the country’s citizens.

There is a Druze diaspora outside of the Middle East, especially in North America and Australia. Their population was expected to be over 700,000 until Syria’s civil conflict broke out in 2011. The Druze have been migrating to southern Syria since the 16th century, to what is now known as Jabal al-Druze or Druze Mountain in Sweida province, according to historian Sami Makarem’s book “The Druze Faith.”

During the ten-year civil war, the Druze who form the majority in the Suwayda region in southern Syria were pushed between the forces of the previous Assad administration and extremist organisations. Druze militias had retained a strong hold on Suweida, resisting appeals to join the security forces.

As the nation then took pride in its secular and Arab nationalist system, religious freedom was ensured under the strict control of the Assad family. Ahmed al-Sharaa also promised to safeguard them, however, his government is regarded with suspicion by them and other minorities.

The new 23-member Syrian cabinet unveiled in late March only featured one Druze member, Minister of Agriculture Amjad Badr, despite the transitional government’s commitment to incorporate minorities, including the Druze.

Earlier, many Druze citizens were slain including extrajudicially, as a result of sectarian warfare against their militias by Syrian transitional government armed forces and associated outfits that started on 28th April. Likewise, Christian and Alawite minority communities faced severe persecution few months after the new administration took charge.

Ahmed al-Sharaa’s ties to terrorism

The war name of Ahmed al-Sharaa was Abu Mohammad al-Jawlani. The United States classified him as a terrorist and the United Nations (UN) proscribed him. Over the past 20 years, he held significant positions in global terrorist organisations like Al Qaeda and ISIS. He was designated a global terrorist in 2013.

He collaborated closely with ISIS chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and Al Qaeda’s Aiman al-Zawahiri. He was instructed by the former to start a local outfit to provide a front for Al Qaeda Iraq and Syria during the 2011 uprising against the Assad regime. The Al-Nusrah Front also called Jabhat al-Nusrah or Jabhat Fatah al-Sham was founded by him in 2012.

This UN-designated terrorist group was officially acknowledged as the Syrian branch of Al Qaeda. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham or HTS became the new name for the Jabhat Fatah al-Sham in 2017. Its main objectives were to overthrow the Assad government and establish an Islamic Caliphate.

The group spearheaded a swift and widespread assault and seized areas which were under the Assad government. Afterward, retaliatory killings became rampant in Syria following Ahmed al-Sharaa’s takeover as his Sunni hardliner supporters and radicals targeted people from minority communities.

Therefore, while some Druze opposed Bashar al-Assad’s dictatorial government, they are also wary of Ahmed al-Sharaa, an Islamist leader with a history of perpetrating Islamic jihad.

The criticism by the court came days after a minor boy tragically fell to his death from a sixth-floor balcony while running from a stray dog in Kalamna.

The bench, comprising Justice Anil Kilor and Justice Manohar Nerlikar, was hearing a 2022 PIL by activist Vijay Talewar. The bench asked the authorities, “How many times must we repeat ourselves?” The PIL has sought sustained action on increasing stray dog attacks across Nagpur city.

Senior counsel Firdos Mirza appeared for the petitioner and flagged the boy’s death as a glaring example of administrative apathy. He told the court, “Under the Mumbai Police Act, the police are duty-bound to prevent such public nuisances. But no concrete preventive mechanism seems to exist.” He asserted that more lives could be lost if authorities continue to shirk their responsibility.

The court, during the hearing, noted that its earlier directives dated 20th October and 23rd November in 2023 had clearly outlined steps for prevention. However, the court found no evidence of compliance.

The court has directed both the police commissioner of the city and the municipal commissioner to submit affidavits detailing the action taken so far, including compliance with past orders, by 23rd July. The next hearing of the matter is scheduled for 25th July.

The judges also sought a clarification on the availability of anti-rabies vaccines in the city. While Mirza cited a persistent shortage, NMC’s counsel Sudhir Puranik claimed vaccines were adequately stocked. The court ordered the discrepancy to be addressed through a separate affidavit.

The PIL names 15 respondents, including the state and central governments, city police, NMC and animal welfare boards. Additional government pleader Deepak Thakare appeared for the state, while Nandesh Deshpande represented the Centre and Ashwin Deshpande for intervenor Dhantoli Nagrik Mandal.

Notably, the stray dog menace in India has reached an epidemic-level emergency, with over 37 lakh cases reported in 2024 alone. While the Government of India has said that cases of rabies have come down significantly, there are many other diseases that are caused by dog bites. Furthermore, diseases are not the only reason for death by stray dogs. Little children, the elderly, the disabled and other vulnerable members of society succumb to injuries and trauma caused by stray dog attacks. Immediate action needs to be taken at the administrative and judiciary level to control the menace without interference from the Animal Welfare Board and dog lovers.",14th july nagpur bench bombay high court sharply criticised nagpur police municipal corporation nmc “consistent inaction” stray dog menace criticism court came day minor boy tragically fell death sixth floor balcony running stray dog kalamna bench comprising justice anil kilor justice manohar nerlikar hearing 2022 pil activist vijay talewar bench asked authority “how many time must repeat ” pil sought sustained action increasing stray dog attack across nagpur city senior counsel firdos mirza appeared petitioner flagged boy’s death glaring example administrative apathy told court “under mumbai police act police duty bound prevent public nuisance concrete preventive mechanism seems exist ” asserted life could lost authority continue shirk responsibility court hearing noted earlier directive dated 20th october 23rd november 2023 clearly outlined step prevention however court found evidence compliance court directed police commissioner city municipal commissioner submit affidavit detailing action taken far including compliance past order 23rd july next hearing matter scheduled 25th july judge also sought clarification availability anti rabies vaccine city mirza cited persistent shortage nmc’s counsel sudhir puranik claimed vaccine adequately stocked court ordered discrepancy addressed separate affidavit pil name 15 respondent including state central government city police nmc animal welfare board additional government pleader deepak thakare appeared state nandesh deshpande represented centre ashwin deshpande intervenor dhantoli nagrik mandal notably stray dog menace india reached epidemic level emergency 37 lakh case reported 2024 alone government india said case rabies come significantly many disease caused dog bite furthermore disease reason death stray dog little child elderly disabled vulnerable member society succumb injury trauma caused stray dog attack immediate action need taken administrative judiciary level control menace without interference animal welfare board dog lover
OpIndia,16/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/maoists-kill-two-teachers-chhattisgarh-on-suspicion-of-being-informers-targeting-innocent-civilians-for-years/,"Fearing wipe-out, Maoists kill two teachers in Chhattisgarh on suspicion of being informers, read how the Naxals have been targeting innocent civilians for years","In another shocking display of Maoist brutality, two young teachers who were appointed under the state’s Shiksha Doot scheme were murdered by Naxals on Tuesday, 15th July, in a remote village deep inside Chhattisgarh’s Indravati National Park area.

The victims, Vinod Made (28) from Pillur village and Suresh Meta (29) from Tekameta village, were dragged out of their homes and executed by Maoists who suspected them of being police informers.

The incident took place about 57 kilometres from the Bijapur district headquarters, under the Farsegad police station limits. According to police, both teachers were temporary recruits under the government’s Education Messenger initiative – a scheme aimed at ensuring basic education in remote villages where deploying permanent teachers remains a challenge. The initiative hires educated local youth and pays them ₹12,000 per month through District Mineral Foundation (DMF) funds. These education messengers often run small primary schools from huts or makeshift classrooms in villages surrounded by dense forest and little security presence.

Why are Maoists killing civilians?

For decades already, Maoists have employed fear, violence, and selective killings to keep huge areas of Chhattisgarh under their grip. When anyone from the native population is suspected of collaborating with or even partially assisting the government, they are promptly accused of being a mukhbir – a police informant. And the punishment, most of the time, is death.

This violent tactic has prevented the area from developing, and schools, roads, and even health clinics remain non-operational or simply non-existent. The Naxals understand that when development arrives in these far-flung tribal enclaves, their power base will dwindle. So they instil terror by targeting not merely security forces, but innocent villagers, teachers, sarpanches, cooks, and government volunteers.

A pattern of blood and fear

The attack comes barely weeks after three villagers were brutally murdered by Maoists on 17th June, 2025, in the Peddakorma (Nayapara) village, also in Bijapur district. According to the police, the victims were choked to death in cold blood. The intention, the officials added, was to instil fear among villagers and discourage them from assisting the administration in any way.

The Maoists had brutally killed at least four villagers on the evening of 12th May. Naga Bhandari, a Congress politician and president of the Marudbaka Society, was among the victims. He had been hacked to death with an axe when he was attending a village function at around 11:30 PM. Maoists had killed his elder brother, Tirupati Bhandari, in October 2024 in the same manner.

Other targets in that 12th May assault were a local education volunteer from Meenagatta, a government-nominated cook from Kanchal, and another local. They were all accused of assisting the government in minor ways, something Maoists disapprove of.

Consistent attacks on security personnel are not safe

Though it is the civilians who have suffered most from Maoist atrocities, the security forces are also vulnerable. An IED explosion by Maoists on 6th January, 2025, killed eight security personnel and one civilian driver in Bijapur’s Abujhmad area. All of them belonged to a combined anti-Naxal operation and were returning from a successful operation where five Maoists were killed.

They were the District Reserve Guard (DRG) and Bastar Fighters personnel, who are special forces raised to fight the Maoists in Bastar. They included DRG head constable Budhram Korsa, constables Baman Sodhi, Pandaru Ram Poyay, Bastar Fighters constables Sudarshan Vetti, Somdu Vetti, Subarnath Yadav, Harish Korram, and civilian driver Tuleshwar Rana.

Police confirmed the explosion on the Kudri Bedre road near Ambeli village was executed with the same methodology observed in the April 2023 Dantewada attack, in which 10 DRG personnel and a civilian were killed. An electric wire was used to detonate the device, a method frequently used by Maoists.

A history of silencing local leadership

Maoists have also periodically attacked village heads and ex-sarpanches. In December 2024, a head constable of the DRG was martyred in an encounter with Maoists in Kohkameta of Abujhmadh. Two ex-sarpanches, one of them a BJP functionary, were killed in Bijapur during the same year.

In a 2023 case, a former sarpanch, Ramji Dodi from Zara village, was kidnapped along with his two nephews. He was kidnapped way into the jungle and murdered by being strangled to death, yet again, on suspicion of being an informer for the police.

The violence persists in 2025

As per official reports, 25 civilians have already been murdered by Maoists in Chhattisgarh in 2025. These include teachers, political workers, education volunteers, and ordinary villagers, who were mostly not directly involved in police activities but were regarded as allies of the system.

What these murders illustrate is not only brutality but desperation. The Maoist insurgency, once the big threat to internal security, is losing steam as development gradually encroaches on their footholds. Increasing numbers of villagers are demanding schooling, improved roadways, and government assistance. And that imperils the very existence of Maoists.

The Union Home Minister has assured that the threat of Left Wing terrorism in India is on the verge of extinction and the country will be made Naxal-Mukt by 31 March 2026. Limited to a mere few districts with dozens of their cadre either being eliminated or surrendering, the Naxals are displaying acts of desperation.",another shocking display maoist brutality two young teacher appointed state’s shiksha doot scheme murdered naxals tuesday 15th july remote village deep inside chhattisgarh’s indravati national park area victim vinod made 28 pillur village suresh meta 29 tekameta village dragged home executed maoist suspected police informer incident took place 57 kilometre bijapur district headquarters farsegad police station limit according police teacher temporary recruit government’s education messenger initiative – scheme aimed ensuring basic education remote village deploying permanent teacher remains challenge initiative hire educated local youth pay ₹12 000 per month district mineral foundation dmf fund education messenger often run small primary school hut makeshift classroom village surrounded dense forest little security presence maoist killing civilian decade already maoist employed fear violence selective killing keep huge area chhattisgarh grip anyone native population suspected collaborating even partially assisting government promptly accused mukhbir – police informant punishment time death violent tactic prevented area developing school road even health clinic remain non operational simply non existent naxals understand development arrives far flung tribal enclave power base dwindle instil terror targeting merely security force innocent villager teacher sarpanches cook government volunteer pattern blood fear attack come barely week three villager brutally murdered maoist 17th june 2025 peddakorma nayapara village also bijapur district according police victim choked death cold blood intention official added instil fear among villager discourage assisting administration way maoist brutally killed least four villager evening 12th may naga bhandari congress politician president marudbaka society among victim hacked death axe attending village function around 11 30 pm maoist killed elder brother tirupati bhandari october 2024 manner target 12th may assault local education volunteer meenagatta government nominated cook kanchal another local accused assisting government minor way something maoist disapprove consistent attack security personnel safe though civilian suffered maoist atrocity security force also vulnerable ied explosion maoist 6th january 2025 killed eight security personnel one civilian driver bijapur’s abujhmad area belonged combined anti naxal operation returning successful operation five maoist killed district reserve guard drg bastar fighter personnel special force raised fight maoist bastar included drg head constable budhram korsa constable baman sodhi pandaru ram poyay bastar fighter constable sudarshan vetti somdu vetti subarnath yadav harish korram civilian driver tuleshwar rana police confirmed explosion kudri bedre road near ambeli village executed methodology observed april 2023 dantewada attack 10 drg personnel civilian killed electric wire used detonate device method frequently used maoist history silencing local leadership maoist also periodically attacked village head ex sarpanches december 2024 head constable drg martyred encounter maoist kohkameta abujhmadh two ex sarpanches one bjp functionary killed bijapur year 2023 case former sarpanch ramji dodi zara village kidnapped along two nephew kidnapped way jungle murdered strangled death yet suspicion informer police violence persists 2025 per official report 25 civilian already murdered maoist chhattisgarh 2025 include teacher political worker education volunteer ordinary villager mostly directly involved police activity regarded ally system murder illustrate brutality desperation maoist insurgency big threat internal security losing steam development gradually encroaches foothold increasing number villager demanding schooling improved roadway government assistance imperils existence maoist union home minister assured threat left wing terrorism india verge extinction country made naxal mukt 31 march 2026 limited mere district dozen cadre either eliminated surrendering naxals displaying act desperation

The scheme has been approved by the cabinet in pursuance of Budget announcement for 2025-26 to develop 100 districts under “Prime Minister Dhan-Dhaanya Krishi Yojana”. The Scheme will be implemented through convergence of 36 existing schemes across 11 Departments, other State schemes and local partnerships with the private sector.

100 districts will be identified based on three key indicators of low productivity, low cropping intensity, and less credit disbursement. The number of districts in each state/UT will be based on the share of Net Cropped Area and operational holdings. However, a minimum of 1 district will be selected from each state.

Committees will be formed at District, State and National level for effective planning, implementation and monitoring of the Scheme. A District Agriculture and Allied Activities Plan will be finalized by the District Dhan Dhaanya Samiti, which will also have progressive farmers as members.

The District Plans will be aligned to the national goals of crop diversification, conservation of water and soil health, self-sufficiency in agriculture and allied sectors as well as expansion of natural and organic farming. Progress of the Scheme in each Dhan-Dhaanya district will be monitored on 117 key Performance Indicators through a dashboard on monthly basis. NITI will also review and guide the district plans. Besides Central Nodal Officers appointed for each district will also review the scheme on a regular basis.

As the targeted outcomes in these 100 districts will improve, the overall average against key performance indicators will rise for the country. The scheme will result in higher productivity, value addition in agriculture and allied sector, local livelihood creation and hence increase domestic production and achieving self-reliance (Atmanirbhar Bharat).

They further accused the latter of purposefully infecting them via HIV contaminated syringes.

Sakina Guru, a transgender Hindu leader stated that Seema Haji, also known as Farzana and Payal alias Naeem Ansari, from Malegaon spearheaded the aggressive conversion campaign against them.

Indore Police has formed a Special Investigation Team (SIT) in response to the allegations. According to Sakina, those who refused received injections from syringes infested with HIV which caused around 60 people to become sick. Twelve of them have been admitted to the ART Centre at MY Hospital. She added that several members of the community have either absconded or joined the perpetrators out of fear.

She mentioned that Payal left his wife and kids behind when he departed Malegaon to Indore in 2000 and started pressuring transsexual people to become Muslims after arrival. Sakina disclosed that she was also coerced into performing the Hajj by Seema who then attempted to convert her. Afterward, she created her own organisation after realising their intentions. However, Seema began to pressure the Hindu members and summoned more Muslim transgenders from Maharashtra.

Sakina’s attorney informed that legal complaints had been submitted to the Police Commissioner, the PMO, the CMO, the CJI and other high-ranking officials. Additionally, he shared videos to support his claims, asserting that approximately 100 sick people, victims of a “Kinnar Jihad,” live in Indore without access to medical supervision.

The conflict has resulted in recurrent altercations between the two parties and police stations in Chandan Nagar and Vijay Nagar have received formal complaints. Last month, a similar unrest at the Pandrinath police station even resulted in the station-in-charge being transferred.

Sakina complained to Collector Ashish Singh following a demonstration at the Pandrinath station. The case was turned over to SDM Nidhi Verma. Police Commissioner Santosh Kumar Singh formed a Special Investigation Team headed by DCP Rishikesh Meena and other top officials in response to protests and a suicide threat from Sakina’s group against police inaction.

OpIndia,16/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/afghan-relocation-uk-taliban-data-breach/,"Thousands of Afghans, including former military officials secretly brought into the UK after Taliban takeover, over 400 million pounds spent on relocation so far","In a 15th July judgment by the King’s Bench Division of the High Court of Britain, it has been revealed that the UK government has been quietly relocating thousands of Afghans following a serious data breach that happened in 2022. The list of media houses seeking removal of the injunction order included Global Media and Entertainment Limited, Independent Digital News and Media Limited, Times Media Limited, Associated Newspapers Limited, Telegraph Media Group, The Financial Times Limited, the Press Association Limited Company and others. OpIndia accessed a copy of the recent judgment.

The recent revelation has triggered widespread concern over the sheer scale of immigration quietly facilitated by the UK government. While the covert operation may have been driven by humanitarian urgency, it has also raised serious questions about transparency, national security, and the lack of public or parliamentary scrutiny in relocating thousands under the radar.

Reportedly, more than 4,500 Afghans, including hundreds of former military personnel, have been relocated to the United Kingdom under a covert government scheme. The information on the relocation was previously hidden from public knowledge under a super-injunction. Notably, the process of relocation was started following a catastrophic data leak that took place in February 2022.

According to media reports, the relocation process was initiated by the UK government in April 2024. Reportedly, a Ministry of Defence (MoD) official disclosed a spreadsheet without any authorisation in February 2022, which exposed names and personal contact details of around 19,000 Afghans who had applied for asylum in the UK following the Taliban’s seizure of power. The leak remained hidden for over a year and was discovered in August 2023 when details of Afghans made their way to Facebook, putting thousands of asylum seekers at risk of Taliban retribution.

According to the MoD, 600 former Afghan soldiers and around 1,800 of their dependants are still in Afghanistan, waiting for evacuation under what is now known as the Afghan Relocation Route. The UK government has already spent taxpayers’ money amounting to 400 million pounds on the relocation process, and around 450 million pounds might be spent on the scheme in the future.

Cover-up and delayed disclosures

For around two years, the breach and subsequent relocation efforts were kept secret from the public as the Conservative government had obtained a super-injunction in 2023. The order barred any reporting on the leak. Interestingly, the order also barred any reporting on the existence of the injunction itself. The order was recently lifted by Justice Chamberlain, who said that the injunction had “completely shut down the ordinary mechanisms of accountability which operate in a democracy”.

Notably, this was the fourth judgment passed by Justice Chamberlain in the matter. The previous three judgments, which were handed over in private, have also been published.

He noted that it gave rise to a “scrutiny vacuum” and raised “serious free speech concerns”. According to media reports, the court documents pointed out that then-Defence Secretary Ben Wallace personally applied for the gag order, allowing the government to mitigate the risks. The MoD later claimed that the Taliban were likely already aware of the dataset, and publication would not significantly increase threats.

Government apologises, but questions linger

Speaking in the House of Commons, Defence Secretary John Healey issued a “sincere apology” to those affected. He acknowledged that the breach was a “serious departmental error”, which was caused by a spreadsheet being emailed outside authorised government systems. Interestingly, no criminal investigation was pursued in the matter by the Metropolitan Police.

While apologising on the matter, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said, “Somebody made a terrible mistake… and we are sorry for that.” However, the government has not disclosed whether any disciplinary action was taken against the official responsible for the leak.

Reportedly, those who were impacted have been informed about the leak, advising them to exercise caution online and avoid responding to unknown contacts. The MoD has refused to confirm if any individuals were harmed as a result of the breach.

The first stages of the initiative, started in 2014, were headed by archaeologist K Amarnath Ramakrishna.

However, a significant political dispute between the Tamil Nadu government and the centre has unfolded by his repeated transfers and the Archaeological Survey of India’s (ASI) reservations about his excavation report.

K Amarnath is now appointed as the Director of the National Mission on Monuments and Antiquity (NMMA) in Greater Noida. He was employed as the Director of the National Mission on Monuments and Antiquity in New Delhi prior to the transfer, which occurred six months after his last assignment. He had previously spent three months in the position of Director for Excavation and Exploration.

K Amarnath was ordered to modify his report by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), however, he denied to comply, leading to a fierce war of words between the central and state governments.

How it all began: The Keeladi findings and its significance

Keeladi also known as Keezhadi is on the Vaigai river basin, situated in the Sivaganga district, approximately 12 kilometers southeast of Madurai. Excavations were started more than ten years ago at the Pallichanthai Tidal in Keeladi which was once a 100-acre coconut grove by Amarnath Ramakrishna, the ASI’s superintending archaeologist at the time. Keeladi stood out among the over 100 locations he had selected for excavation along the Vaigai River.

Over 7,500 ancient artefacts, such as wells, drainage systems and wall structures were discovered there, pointing to a thriving and advanced urban society. These materials were disclosed to be more than 2,160 years old, dating to the second century BCE (Before Common Era) which coincides with Tamil history’s Sangam period, according to carbon dating.

The ASI conducted the first three of the eight rounds of excavations. After the Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology (TNSDA) assumed responsibility for the project, the artefacts accumulated to over 18,000, which included pottery, inscribed potsherds, gold ornaments, copper articles, semi-precious stones, shell and ivory bangles, glass beads, spindle whorls, terracotta seals, and weaving tools.

The location produced more than 120 potsherds with Tamil Brahmi inscriptions. The discovery alongside thousand inscribed potsherds from other areas demonstrated the script’s continued existence in the region. Copper needles, clay seals, spinning whorls, yarn hanging stones, terracotta spheres, and earthen containers for liquids alluded to different stages of the weaving industry.

They also indicated that Keeladi was a strong, well-planned and sophisticated urban community with traces of businesses like beadmaking, dyeing and pottery. The artistic, culturally diverse and affluent lifestyle of the Keeladi people is reflected in gold decorations, copper objects, semi-precious stones, shell bangles, ivory bangles and ivory combs.

Beads made of carnelian and agate reflected importation through business networks. Furthermore, their recreational interests had been disclosed through the uncovering of terracotta and ivory dice, gamesmen and signs of hopscotch which also revealed the presence of an elite society. It was also unearthed that the area’s fertility and cow husbandry were key factors in its development, opening the door for the locals to engage in sea trading and produce an abundance of rice.

The results showcased a far older and more developed civilisation than previously believed, pushing the Sangam Age in Tamil Nadu back to about 800 BCE, as per reports. The Sangam Age, also known as the Tamil Sangam period, is a significant period in the history of South India. It was named for the Sangam, an assembly of Tamil poets and academics, saw a flourishing of literature and culture in southern India. It was generally accepted to have occurred between approximately 300 BCE and 300 CE (Common Era).

The Keeladi objects displayed certain symbols that were similar to those of the Indus Valley Civilization. However, there is cultural separation of roughly 1,000 years and scholars anticipated that more research would shed light on this relationship.

Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology asserted that Keeladi possessed all the hallmarks of an urban civilisation, including brick buildings, upscale goods and evidence of both domestic and international trade. It presented itself as a highly developed and hard-working civilisation and provided proof of Tamil Nadu’s urban life and settlements throughout the Early Historic Period. Additionally, Keeladi only strengthened Sangam Literature’s legitimacy.

Strong structures orientated in cardinal directions unveiled systematic urban planning and pot fragments with Tamil Brahmi inscriptions confirmed a literate culture. The sun and moon graffiti revealed the people’s astronomical awareness.

Keeladi was an urban town from the Sangam era and the cultural deposits discovered during the fourth phase of excavations could be easily dated to a time between the sixth and first centuries BCE, according to a 2019 report from the Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology. One of the six samples sent to the United States for carbon testing was dated 580 BCE. It was taken at a depth of 353 centimetres.

Notably, according to the findings presented in the report, the Keeladi artefacts date back approximately 300 years earlier than the previously believed 3rd century BCE.

Ramakrishna’s discovery and subsequent transfer

Keeladi was found by Amarnath Ramakrishna, who supervised the first two seasons of excavations from 2014 to 2016 and handed over a 982-page report to ASI Director General V. Vidyavathi. The report’s twelve chapters provided an explanation of the excavation’s goals and historical context.

The 23 samples that were dated using Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) at the Beta Analytical Lab in Florida of the United States were covered in a different chapter. It also incorporated research on floral and faunal remains from the site to arrive at the period, as well as discoveries from other universities, as per reports.

The first two phases of excavation at Keeladi yielded about 5,800 artefacts after which Ramakrishna was transferred to Assam. The action was reportedly viewed as a setback to the effort. The centre was accused by critics of purposefully sabotaging the excavations because it had committed to release funds and support for additional digging, but postponed both.

Meanwhile, the excavations had already progressed into their third phase under archaeologist PS Sriraman. Interestingly, Sriraman announced that there was no continuity in the brick constructions that had been found earlier, after 400 square meters of excavation. As a result, claims emerged from Tamil Nadu that the centre was actively ‘downplaying’ Keeladi’s prominence, aided by the usual political narratives of anti-North India sentiments that is seen in Tamil political discourse.

TN Govt took up excavation project after ASI stopped, found 13,000 more items

The ASI halted excavations at the site, arguing that the third phase produced no significant outcomes. However, the work was taken over by the Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology in 2017 and thousands of artefacts have since been unearthed. The ninth phase of the excavations was launched by Chief Minister MK Stalin in April 2023 and ended in September of the same year.

The Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology has been able to uncover more than 13,000 items and acquire radiocarbon dates from 580 BCE to 200 CE. The excavations, entered their tenth phase by 2024-2025 and already produced hundreds of antiques.

Furthermore, a 30-foot-long new structure has recently been found at the third trench of the Keeladi excavation after ASI ruled out the possibility of any noteworthy discovery at the site. The bricks used in this new structure are identical in design and make to those used in other parts.

“The bricks used in this new structure are identical in design and make to those used in other parts of Keeladi, strengthening the authenticity of the findings. Earlier studies by Amarnath Ramakrishna’s team had already suggested the area might have housed industrial zones,” V Marappan, Professor of History at Presidency College, outlined while talking to The Federal.

He added, “These new findings raise questions about whether other sections of the site remain unexcavated underground.” The new structure, east-west orientated was discovered 90 centimetres below the surface on the western side. Its length is estimated to be approximately 10 meters. According to archaeologists, it might have been an industrial building or a workshop.

Madras High Court intervenes

The matter made its way to the judiciary in the interim. Judges from the Madras High Court intervened and travelled to the excavation site. They asked the ASI to carry on with the excavations and permit the involvement of the Tamil Nadu Department of Archaeology. The archaeology department of the state followed the instruction.

It had been working on it since the third phase of excavation, giving a more dramatic turn to the events. The court’s Madurai bench in 2019 pronounced that the excavations should not stop since significant advancements in Tamil civilisation had been uncovered while considering a number of petitions that sought an order to the state and the centre to preserve the archaeological sites in Tamil Nadu.

The public would learn more about Tamil civilisation through the archaeological excavations, thus Division Bench consisting of Justices D. Krishnakumar and R. Vijayakumar advised the relevant authorities to ensure that they were carried out without any obstacles.

The court even ordered the centre to send back Amarnath Ramakrishna to Tamil Nadu within 15 days to continue the excavations. Amarnath Ramakrishna, who had been moved back to the state, put forth his report on the first two stages of excavation in January 2023.

Last year, the High Court even sent a notice to the centre demanding the ASI to release the report that was provided following the first two stages of the excavations. The centre received notice regarding the petition filed by Madurai resident P. Prabhakar Pandian from the bench.

The state and the centre were also instructed to submit more counter-affidavits to several public interest litigation petitions concerning the excavations, in the same year. It ordered the authorities to present the rebuttal affidavits to the 2016 and 2017 petitions which had asked the relevant authorities for guidance on how to proceed with the excavations at Keeladi rather than shutting down the site.

One of the petitions asked the government to establish a “site museum” at Keeladi. Stalin opened a Rs 18.43 crore Keeladi museum in March 2023 on two acres.

The Madurai bench even granted the Archaeological Survey India’s request to relocate the artefacts from the excavation to its Dehradun lab for further scientific analysis, in 2016. It was instructed to notify the state’s archaeology commissioner prior to the move. The commissioner was told to record videos and take pictures of the items. The ASI was given directions to return the objects to Tamil Nadu and provide a report to the court.

Controversy erupts between the Centre, Tamil Nadu govt

The 982-page final report was given by Ramakrishna in January 2023, following preliminary and interim submissions in 2016 and 2017, respectively. It had been with the ASI for almost two and a half years and it wrote to Ramakrishna in May seeking a revision.

The Archaeological Survey of India raised concerns regarding the dating and profoundity of specific outcomes. It underscored that the evidence for the earliest period seemed to be quite early and stated that it needed further examination.

According to the letter, “the three periods require proper nomenclatures or re-orientation.” It remarked that the “8th century BCE to 5th century BCE for Period I requires concrete justification.” It also noted that “just mentioning depth for the available scientific dates is not enough but the layer number should also be marked for comparative consistency analysis.” The ASI also demanded that the manner in which dates were presented should also be amended.

However, Amarnath Ramakrishna refused to modify his results, maintaining that his research was sound from a scientific standpoint and supported by strict archaeological standards. He maintained that material culture, stratigraphic sequences and even Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) corroborated the report’s chronology.

A number of Tamil Nadu political groups, including the ruling-Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), the Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi and historian R. Balakrishnan, denounced the ASI’s move as an attempt to stifle Tamil culture. They accused that the failure to recognise Keeladi’s importance was motivated by politics.

On the other hand, Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, the Union Minister for Culture, stated that additional scientific research was necessary to validate Ramakrishnan’s conclusions because they lacked technical support. He asserted that a single finding could not alter the entire discourse and therefore, more data, outcomes and proofs were needed to be collected.

Shekhawat stated that Tamil Nadu is a vital part of India and that its history should be honoured using knowledge based on science rather than polarising opinions. He informed Stalin that the union government would not hesitate to publish any reports and would be delighted to support the state if the research was validated by science.

The union minister declared that more convincing evidence is required for the report to be accepted by the scientific community. He even questioned was the Tamil Nadu government had been reluctant to work with the centre on this matter due to which the conflict has persisted.

“People holding such positions are trying to use that to grow regional sentiments. That is not fair. We have to be very cautious. Let archaeologists, historians, and technical experts discuss this, instead of politicians,” he mentioned.

However, Thangam Thennarasu, Tamil Nadu’s Archaeology Minister, charged that the union government treats Tamils as second-class citizens. He complained, “They also refused to allocate funds for the excavations and allowed the report to gather dust for two years. Now they say there is no adequate evidence. Every time they reject Tamil history, only the method of rejection changes.”

Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam’s (MDMK) Vaiko also claimed that the centre was attempting to promote “a non-existent Sanskrit civilisation” while repressing Tamil civilisation.

“How many obstacles do Tamils face? We have been fighting against all of them for thousands of years, and with the help of science, we have been establishing the antiquity of our race. Yet some minds refuse to accept it. It’s not the statements that need to be corrected, it’s some minds,” MK Stalin recently shared on social media last month while reacting on Ramakrishna’s recent transfer.

Communist Party of India (Marxist) MP from Madurai S Venkatesan expressed, “Transferring an official is not in itself a major issue, it is part of administrative procedures. But Amarnath Ramakrishna worked on the Keeladi excavation for eight years, without compromising on the truth. He was removed, reassigned and denied the opportunity to publish his findings. Only after court intervention was he allowed to write the report.”

He conveyed that the ASI had promised the court and Parliament that the report would be released in 11 months, but that deadline had not been fulfilled while the centre now wants more scientific proof at the final stage. “The message is clear: If you do not align with our views, this is what will be done to you. This is not just about an individual, it’s a discriminatory act against Tamil Nadu and against South Indian history itself,” he alleged.

The AIADMK (All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam) which was in power when the Keeladi report was issued, did not comment on the dispute for a long time. On 18th June, however, its senior leader and former minister RB Udhayakumar stated that the union government had requested further data in order to provide “additional corroboration.” He added that his party would be the first one to voice its disapproval if the Keeladi report was rejected.

Stalin accused the party of remaining silent while the centre minimised the importance of the location to which Udhayakumar retorted that his party’s government had approved Rs 55 lakh for the 2018 excavations. Mafoi Pandiarajan, a senior AIADMK leader who helmed archaeology under Edappadi Palaniswamy, praised him as “Keeladi Nayakar” (hero of Keeladi) and gave him credit for proving Tamil antiquity. A veteran DMK leader retaliated, “Their belated pride in Keeladi rings hollow when they put alliance politics above Tamil identity.”

Central government demands excavation report

The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has asked retired superintending archaeologist PS Sriraman to present the official excavation report for the third phase of the Keeladi excavations. He handled the short-lived third phase in 2017 after Ramakrishna’s abrupt transfer and reported that no major discoveries were made.

He retired in 2019 and has been given permission by the agency to write reports on the excavations he supervised in Keeladi, where he headed the third phase of excavations. He was also involved in the work for one season at Kodumanal which is situated on the northern banks of the Noyyal River in the Erode district, between 2017-2018.

According to archaeologists, Kodumanal could be split into two cultural periods: the Megalithic era and the Prehistoric era. During these times, the locals built durable structures, were skilled craftspeople and engaged in trade with several nations.

Sriraman would be writing the report from the ASI office in Chennai. He talked to The Hindu and revealed, “As I had retired, both reports were pending. I sought the approval of the ASI to access the material and prepare the reports. Since all the related materials are in Chennai, I will begin preparing the reports soon.”

He reiterated, “I have sought permission to complete the report since I am retired now. A formal communication from the ASI is expected soon,” while speaking with Deccan Herald. “The ASI instructed me to complete as quickly as possible. I am concentrating more on Kodumanal because it is an individual work – my work while the third phase in Keezhadi is for a shorter period and it was a continuation of work done earlier,” he asserted in conversation with The New Indian Express.

This comes more than a month after Ramakrishna was asked by the ASI to “resubmit” his report following the necessary changes recommended by two experts who reviewed it.

New dawn in India’s history: Traces of parallel civilization

The Keeladi site has unveiled a pivotal chapter in the history of Tamil Nadu. The indication that an artifact belonged to the 6th century BCE by the US laboratory Beta Analytics holds a major significance. They used the method of radiocarbon dating and suggested that it was contemporary with the urbanisation of the Gangetic plains.

The oldest of the 29 radiocarbon samples dated by the Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology since the 2017-18 excavation season was 580 BCE and the most recent was 200 CE. The results indicated that between the sixth century BCE and the second century CE, there was a vibrant urban and industrial civilisation that lasted for 800 years.

Large brick buildings from the Sangam Age had been discovered and provided proof of the development discussed in Sangam literature. Archaeologist K Rajan who is advisor to Tamil Nadu’s archaeology department voiced, “Most samples above the brick structures date to after the 3rd century BCE, while those below go as far back as the 6th century BCE,” reported The Times of India.

With the use of 3D technology and anthropometric measurements from a skull discovered at the Kondagai burial site, archaeologists are one step closer to unveiling the face of the ancient Tamil people who inhabited the Keeladi settlement thousands of years ago. Rajan stated, “Based on the skull, we will reconstruct the age, dietary pattern, determine the gender, and actual face of the person.”

He added, “This places Keeladi alongside the urbanisation of the Gangetic plains, India’s second urbanisation. Of the 29 radiocarbon dates, 12 fall in the pre-Ashokan era, before the 3rd century BCE.”

Over 20 research institutions from India and abroad are working with the state archaeology department to recreate life in Keeladi in 580 BCE. These involve Liverpool University in the United Kingdom, the University of Pisa in Italy, the Field Museum in Chicago, the French Institute of Pondicherry, IIT Gandhinagar and Deccan College.

Animal bones discovered in Keeladi are under examination at the Deccan College. The bones of bulls, buffaloes, goats, cows, sheep, dogs, pigs, antelope and spotted deer were located during excavations. Researchers at Madurai Kamaraj University are looking into ancient animal and human DNA in order to gain further insight into the mixing and human migration of the ancient residents of Keeladi and Kondagai, a Keeladi cluster hamlet.

A single site has produced 29 dates applying this scientific method. “It shows Keeladi was an urban settlement with a literate society and a community of artisans. It was an industrial hub along an ancient trade route linking the east coast port of Alagankulam to Muziris on the west coast via Madurai,” mentioned R Sivanandam, joint director of state archaeology department.

However, the settlement’s original name is still unknown. Towns, streets, palace structures, decorations, gemstones and international trade are part of Sangam literature. “Keeladi has proved that Sangam literature was a lived experience of ancient Tamils and not imaginative stories,” conveyed indologist R Balakrishnan.

At the site, archaeologists uncovered rectangular and cubic pieces of clay and ivory dice that, according to Balakrishnan, are referenced in “Kalithogai” the sixth of the eight anthologies of Sangam literature.

Rajan emphasised, “Keeladi isn’t the only site with roots in the 6th century BCE. Kodumanal, Porunthal, Sivagalai, Adichanallur and Korkai have also yielded dates from that period. Korkai has produced a date as early as 785 BCE, suggesting Sangam-age urbanisation was widespread.”

Only 4% of the 110 acres of cultural deposit at Keeladi have been unearthed by researchers in ten seasons of excavation. The state government intends to execute further excavations and has established a museum to display the discoveries. There are also plans for an on-site museum which will be the first of its sort in the country.

“Tamil Nadu has endured archaeological apathy for far too long until Keeladi sparked a wave of interest among Tamils,” complained Balakrishnan. Rajan expressed, “Keeladi is the first site that transformed the understanding of archaeology in Tamil Nadu.”

Faces from Keeladi

Meanwhile, a first-of-its-kind forensic facial reconstruction project coordinated by experts from Madurai Kamaraj University and Liverpool John Moores University restored the faces of two individuals who lived in the Keeladi region more than 2,500 years ago. Researchers described the facial features as South Indian with signs of ancient Austro-Asiatic people and West Eurasian (Iranian) hunter-gatherers.

The skulls were discovered around 800 meters from the main excavation site at Kondagai, a burial site. They added that more DNA research is required to identify the genetic ancestry.

Professor Caroline Wilkinson, director of Face Lab at Liverpool John Moores University informed, “We used a computer-assisted 3D facial reconstruction system to rebuild the facial musculature and estimate facial features following anatomical and anthropometrical standards. . As the lower jaws of the skulls were missing, we used orthodontic standards to estimate the shapes of the mandibles from cranial measurements and planes,” according to a report in The Times of India.

According to professor G Kumaresan of Madurai Kamaraj University’s genetics department which scanned and sent pictures of the skulls to Liverpool, “It is 80% science and 20% art.” He outlined that the DNA information and the recreated faces could be useful in determining the lineage of Tamils who lived during the Sangam era.

Critical moment in India’s civilisational journey

The 90-by-60-meter excavated area contains artefacts like as dice, unidentified copper coins, glass, shell, ivory, pearl, and terracotta beads, seals and gold decorations. More importantly, it is one of the few locations in Tamil Nadu, along with Arikamedu, Kaveripattinam and Korkai, to produce a broad range of structures, including intricate brick constructions, tank-like drainage systems, double-walled furnaces and terracotta ring wells.

All of this not only indicates a vibrant, literate and successful urbanized community but also emphasizes the advanced nature of Indian civilization. Its origins trace back to the timeline of the Gangetic plains which also illuminate how India has been home to not just one but multiple prime civilizations and flourishing communities residing in both the northern and southern regions of this vast country for many centuries. Furthermore, the discoveries indicated that they were also linked to the external world.

Such developments not only reinforce the deep civilizational roots of this ancient country but also aid in comprehending the elements of our age-old society. The myths surrounding foreigners who landed in the country and established their communities are also debunked by these revelations, which confirm that the nation has been the cradle of multiple ancient advanced settlements displaying city planning, trade, leisure and all indications of a vibrant cultural society.

These discoveries are therefore not merely a matter of pride but are crucial in preserving our civilizational foundations, comprehending and sustaining a continuous connection with our past, as well as understanding our background. Certainly, the sophisticated perspective of our forebears and the societies they formed and preserved over centuries is truly a subject of admiration.

Intellectuals, historians, epigraphists, geologists and archaeology aficionados have all been drawn to Keeladi to analyse the historical relevance it provides to society and it has even prompted several research investigations.

OpIndia,15/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/chhangur-baba-is-tip-of-iceberg-unmasking-islamist-playbook-of-sexual-exploitation-forced-conversions-blackmail-subversion-in-india/,"Chhangur Baba is just tip of the iceberg: Unmasking the Islamist playbook of sexual exploitation, forced conversions, blackmail, and foreign-funded subversion in India","The Uttar Pradesh Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) recently exposed a Rs 100 crore Islamic conversion racket run by Jalaluddin alias Chhangur Baba in Balrampur. This jihadist racket luring non-Muslims, especially Hindu girls, into conversion through romantic relationships, force or allurement, however, is not the first such case; rather, it is yet another player executing a sinister playbook of love trap, sexual coercion, blackmail, and foreign funding targeting and converting Hindus to Islam.

Even as the Islamo-leftist ecosystem is hell bent on establishing the narrative that Love Jihad is a BJP-orchestrated conspiracy theory, hoax and yet another form of ‘Islamophobia’, a systematic operation of targeting Hindu women for conversion through the ensnarement of love, manipulation, coercion, and financial incentives is being carried out by various Islamist organisations.

While a Muslim youth getting slapped inside a Hindu temple for harassing young girls makes headlines in big Indian and foreign newspapers, the cases of grooming Jihad and Islamic conversion rackets targeting Hindu minor girls do not even qualify as newsworthy. However, it is pertinent to delve into the murky waters of this jihadist anti-Hindu conspiracy to unravel the recurring pattern and the Islamist ploy of bringing demographic change besides asserting Islamic dominance.

The Jalaluddin-run Islamic conversion racket

On the 5th of July 2025, the Uttar Pradesh ATS arrested Jalaluddin alias ‘Chhangur Baba’ along with his wife, on Saturday (5th July) from Gomti Nagar. Jalaluddin ran an Islamic conversion racket spread across the country. This racket run by Jalaluddin involved foreign funding worth hundreds of crores. It has been reported that Jalaluddin received foreign funding of approximately Rs 500 crores, with Rs 200 crores confirmed and the remaining Rs 300 crores allegedly sent through Nepal.

More than 100 bank accounts were opened in the border districts of Nepal, including Kathmandu, Nawalparasi, Rupandehi, and Banki, receiving money from Islamic countries.

His entire family was involved in the racket. Jalaluddin’s son, Mehboob and a close aide were arrested by the ATS in April this year. Subsequently, following an investigation, the ATS registered a case against 10 people including Jalaluddin, who had a reward of Rs 50,000 on him.

Jalaluddin used to provide money to Muslim men for luring Hindu women and converting them to Islam. The Muslim men used to fake their identities and take Hindu names to target Hindu women. Jalaluddin used to perform Muslim marriages (Nikaah) of these Muslim men with Hindu women whom they lured or forced to convert. He and several members of his gang reportedly travelled to Islamic countries around 40 times.

Chhangur Baba had a fixed incentive structure for conversions. Rs 15-16 lakh was fixed for conversions of Brahmin, Sikh or Kshatriya women, Rs 10-12 lakhs for OBCs and Rs 8-10 lakhs for other castes. The accused Chhangur Baba had also published a book, ‘Shijra-e-Tayyaba’, meaning ‘To propagate Islam’.

Not only Hindu girls, but Hindu men have also been on the radar of Jalaluddin’s gang. A Hindu man named Sanchit, who used to work as a sweeper at Chhangur Baba’s residence, revealed that Jalaluddin tormented him and his family for refusing to convert to Islam. Besides threats and torture, Jamaluddin also offered financial inducements to his targets for conversion to Islam.

The Hindu victim told the media that Jalaluddin aka Chhangur Baba tried to lure him to convert to Islam by offering him Rs 5 lakh, and even promised to build his house and gift him a bike. When Sanchit rejected the offer and refused to convert to Islam, Chhangur Baba threatened to kill him.

In another case linked to Chhangur Baba, a 15-year-old Hindu girl was lured, trapped, and sexually exploited by her Muslim neighbours Aamir Hussain and his sister Neha Khan and subsequently by others under the control of Chhangur Peer’s gang in Haryana’s Faridabad. Her Hindu identity was systematically erased, she was forced to offer Namaz, eat meat, wear Burqa, and her abuse was filmed to be used as blackmail by her captors.

In Lucknow, a Hindu woman named Manvi Sharma was lured by a Muslim man, Meraj Ansari, who posed as ‘Rudra Sharma’ to trap her. She was taken to Kanpur, forcibly converted to Islam, and married off under the supervision of Jamaluddin alias Chhangur Peer. Later, she was tortured and blackmailed with obscene videos.

In Balrampur, a Hindu man, Harjeet, was harassed, blackmailed, and ultimately forced to convert to Islam by Chhangur Peer and his aide Abdul Mabdud. Lured with job promises, then threatened with false cases, he later returned to Hinduism.

UP ATS busted an Islamic conversion racket which targeted differently-abled children and village girls

Back in 2021, the Uttar Pradesh Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) unearthed a mass conversion racket and arrested Maulana Mohammed Umar Gautam and his accomplice Mufti Qazi Jehangir from Delhi for allegedly forcing over 1,000 people to adopt Islam. The duo, who ran an organisation named Islamic Dawah Centre (IDC), along with their other associates, were charged for mass conversion of people into Islam through inducements such as marriage, job and money and mental pressure.

The perpetrators brainwashed the differently-abled children into hating non-Muslims, accepting Islam and were planning to use them as suicide bombers, as the scope of retaliation from such children is limited.

The ATS recovered a list with the names of 31 non-Muslim girls who fell into their conversion trap, and most of these girls belonged to rural areas. On questioning, the accused reportedly told the ATS officials that it was easier to brainwash girls living in villages into embracing Islam. They are mostly uneducated and belong to lesser privileged families. So it becomes easier to lure them with jobs and financial aid, which is exactly what Umar Gautam did to lure his target into embracing Islam.

It was reported that the conversion racket run by Mufti Qazi Jahangir Qasmi and Mohammad Umar Gautam had funding from India’s most wanted terrorist and Jamaat-ud-Dawah chief Hafiz Saeed. This conversion racket was being operated as a ‘motivation camp’. Moreover, Islamic Dawah Centre- Umar Gautam’s organisation’s links with the infamous Islamist preacher Zakir Naik’s aide were also unearthed. It also emerged that Pakistan’s ISI was also funding this conversion racket.

The ATS launched a manhunt to trace students of the Noida Deaf Society (NDS) who were coerced to convert to Islam in the past few years.

Dalit girl abducted from Prayagraj, taken to Kerala for forced conversion and prepped for Jihad

In June 2025, an underage girl from Uttar Pradesh’s Prayagraj was trapped and brought from her village to Kerala, where she was forced to embrace Islam and recruited for terrorist operations. A 15-year-old Dalit girl was lured from her village in the Phulpur area of Prayagraj and was then transported to Kerala by 19-year-old Kahkasha Bano and 25-year-old Mohammad Kaif, where she was forced to convert to Islam and coerced into preparing for jihad. The shocking matter came to light on 28th June after Guddi Devi reported that a local woman named Kahkashan alias Darkasha Bano took her daughter in the name of better opportunities and money. The Hindu Dalit girl was also molested by Mohammad Kaif.

The police suspected that an inter-state jihadi nexus has been operating to lure Hindu girls to Islam and train them for Jihadist activities.

According to DCP Gunawat, the girl was exposed to dubious people who initially enticed her with money, then persuaded her to change her religion and later pressured her to participate in extremist activities. He mentioned that Bano seemed to be associated with a Kerala-based organisation that uses compulsion and seduction to convert young females before preparing them for jihad.

The police said that Bano is a part of an organised gang also involved in terrorist and anti-national activities by luring poor and Dalit girls, brainwashing them and forcing them to convert their religion.

Two Hindu sisters brainwashed, recruited into an Islamic conversion network linked to J&K and ISIS fronts

In June 2025, two Hindu sisters from Uttar Pradesh’s Agra district were brainwashed and converted to Islam. The elder sister was the first to fall victim to the vicious trap of religious grooming and conversion by her own friend named Saima, who was from Udhampur, J&K. Later on, she groomed her younger sister. Both sisters were missing for several months.

The elder daughter used to study at Dayalbagh Educational Institute in Agra. There she came in contact with Saima, who was a Muslim. The family of the victims told police that their elder daughter was so brainwashed by Saima that she disappeared in 2021. She returned after some time, but she was not the same person anymore. The family said that after coming back, she began brainwashing her younger sister. Subsequently, both sisters disappeared from their home on March 25, 2025.

After a case was registered, the police launched an investigation and found that the case followed the pattern of religious conversion of vulnerable Hindu girls, similar to what was shown in the movie ‘The Kerala Story’. The Hindu sisters transitioned from being a victim of an Islamic conversion racket to an active part of the same jihadist gang.

UP: Religious conversion racket operated by Hina busted in Moradabad, husband Mustafa used to pressurise Hindu women to convert

In September 2024, the Uttar Pradesh police exposed an Islamic conversion racket in the Moradabad district. This racket was run by a married Muslim couple, Mustafa and Hina. They operated a conversion racket in the guise of their sewing and embroidery centre. Mustafa was also accused of sexually abusing a Hindu girl and recording it. He had also threatened the victim that he would leak her obscene video. The Police arrested the accused duo after a Hindu girl lodged a complaint.

Mustafa also used to pressure the Hindu girls and women who came to the centre to eat with him. Whenever the Hindu girls and women refused to comply, he would keep on insisting and harassing them.

The Kerala Story: Lived reality of Hindu victims dismissed by Islamo-leftists as ‘propaganda’

While Islamists and their left liberal cheerleaders often deny the prevalence of love jihad, outrightly dismissing the lived reality of the Hindu victims as ‘hoax’ and ‘conspiracy theory’, organised efforts by Islamists to humiliate, subjugate and convert non-Muslims to Islam have been ongoing at a large scale across the country, especially in Kerala.

Muslim youth in the state often entice Hindu and even Christian females at the urging of their religious leaders. These girls are married and converted to Islam before they are shipped to Middle Eastern nations like Syria and Iraq, where they are either utilised as sex slaves or as terrorists.

Kerala has been recognised as a significant centre for ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant), with its origins traced back to 2013 in the state. It established a foothold there, creating modules that encourage religious conversions in early 2014. The prohibited terrorist group, Popular Front of India (PFI), is primarily responsible for turning Kerala into a hotspot for ISIS recruitment.

Kerala has seen a large number of conversions, particularly between 2008 and 2009. The females were transferred to ISIS along with their Muslim husbands. The horrifying tales finally gained attention in 2016 after they were first detained and then investigated in Afghanistan. The instance of the four girls who joined ISIS in 2016 with their spouses was one of the most infamous cases.

They were identified as Merrin Jacob Pallath alias Mariyam, Nimisha alias Fathima Isa, Raffaela and Sonia Sebastian alias Ayisha. Nimisha was Hindu, while the other three were Christians. Nimisha wed an MBA graduate from Palakkad named Bexin Vincent. They took the names Fathima and Isa after their conversion.

Merrin Jacob was married to Bestin Vincent, also known as Yahiya, Bexin’s brother. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) identified the architect behind this entire plan as Abdul Rashid Abdulla, a resident of Kasargod, whom Sonia Sebastian married in 2011. Raffaela was married to a doctor from Kasargod named Ijas Kallukettiya Purayil. Kerala has a hotbed of radical Muslims working for ISIS in war-torn countries.

In 2016, cases of systematic love jihad were reported in the media. In July 2016, Mini Vijayan, a military official, alleged that her daughter Aparna had been forcefully converted to Islam. Aparna was traced to Sathyasarani, or the Markazul Hidaya Educational and Charitable Trust in Malappuram. Aparna later appeared before the court and claimed to have converted to Islam and that she did not wish to go back to her mother. It turned out that Aparna had married an auto-driver named Aashiq from Malappuram. Investigations revealed that the literature from fugitive Islamic hate preacher Zakir Naik’s Islamic Research Foundation was widely used to brainwash and radicalise Hindu girls.

In another case involving a Hindu girl named Nimisha, in 2011, Kerala police arrested two persons named Sheena Farzana and Naser, two alleged ‘handlers’ who were recruiting young girls in Kerala to go and ‘work’ for ISIS in Yemen. They were both from Sathyasarani, an organisation run by the now-outlawed Islamist jihadist outfit PFI. Investigations led to the discovery of several other targeted conversions. Nimisha, alongside 21 other Hindu girls, converted to Islam and married Muslim men who were recruited by the Islamic terrorist group ISIS.

In 2017, when NIA started probing the ISIS link and Love Jihad cases, they found that two Hindu girls, Athira and Akhila (who later became Hadiya) were lured by the same woman, a PFI worker named Sainaba. All these cases had links with the Sathyasarani Trust or the Markazul Hidaya in Malappuram. Documents were found during a raid indicating that around 60 to 70 Hindu and Christian girls were at the Markazul Hidaya for ‘religious studies’ (conversion studies). Many such organisations are operating in Kerala, backed with heavy funding. The vote bank politics and the fear of offending the perennially offended, coupled with other factors, have caused sluggish probes in these cases.

Another such case was reported by a Christian mother from Kerala named Cynthia, who said that her daughter Tabitha, who was studying in a Gulf nation, had suddenly left after declaring that she wanted to embrace Islam. She eventually established a Bahrain-based Islamic organisation called Discover Islam Society. During a meeting with her mother, a Hijab-clad Tabitha told her mother that she could not live with people who are not Muslims.

Back in 2016, it was reported that between 2011 and 2015, 5,975 people in the state had converted to Islam, of these 1410 converted in 2015 alone.

The Islamo-leftist ecosystem and the so-called ‘secular’ political parties have long been trivialising the menace of love jihad/rape jihad/grooming jihad as a ‘hoax’, ‘fiction’, and ‘BJP-RSS conspiracy theory’ despite there being ample evidence and thousands of cases across the country. Back in 2023, a major controversy erupted when the film The Kerala Story showed how Hindu girls are targeted, brainwashed, sexually abused, threatened and coerced into conversion to Islam and subsequently forced into terror and other illegal activities. Predictably, the same Islamo-leftist ecosystem was outraged and labelled the film as a product of ‘Hindutva’ conspiracy theory.

Muslim grooming gang in Beawar trapped, threatened, raped, blackmailed and pushed Hindu girls to convert to Islam

The term “Grooming gangs” evokes chilling parallels across many countries, most notably the infamous rape jihad cases in the United Kingdom wherein, for nearly four decades, gangs predominantly comprising Pakistani Muslim men systematically groomed, blackmailed, raped and tortured White Christian and other non-Muslim girls. In India, the disturbing cases of sexual exploitation of minor Hindu girls by a Muslim grooming gang have been uncovered in several districts. The Beawar case inevitably recalls the 1992 Ajmer sex scandal, one of India’s most infamous grooming gang cases.

In Rajasthan’s Beawar, the local police busted a gang of illiterate Muslim youths Rehan Mohammad (20), Sohail Mansuri (19), Lukman (20), Arman Pathan (19), Sahil Qureshi (19), and two minors, who were trapping Hindu girls, raping them, and forcing them to convert to Islam. These rape jihadis were teaching Hindu girls about namaz, roza, and reciting the Kalma (Islamic declaration of faith). Furthermore, they were pressuring the girls to wear burqas, perform namaz, observe Roza (fast) and brainwash them for conversion to Islam.

As per a victim’s testimony, these rape jihadis used to follow Hindu girls studying in class 10th at a school in Beawar’s Bijainagar. After coming in contact with the girls over mobile phone, they would sexually assault the girls, take explicit pictures and videos of the crime and then use them to further abuse them. The accused would give small mobile phones to the victims.

The victims said that the men would come in new vehicles, including Bullet motorcycles and other cars, to take them away.

In a striking similarity with the Chhangur Baba conversion racket’s modus operandi, one of the victims in the Beawar grooming jihad case said, “They once told me that a Brahmin girl would fetch ₹20 lakh if sold, and you (a Dalit) would get ₹10 lakh.” The girls said in their statements that they were continuously blackmailed with obscene photos and videos and forced to bring in other girls. One of the victims from Beawar disclosed that the ‘Muslim gang’ used to pressurise her to go to the local maulvis and mosques. In Rajasthan’s Bhilwara, the police busted a similar grooming jihad racket earlier this year.

MP: Congress councillor Anwar Qadri gave lakhs to Muslim men to trap Hindu girls

In July 2025, Anwar Qadri, Congress councillor from Indore of Madhya Pradesh, were charged under the National Security Act (NSA) for orchestrating “love jihad” and using financial inducement to trap Hindu women. The action took place after Muslim men identified him as the person who paid them to target Hindu women and convert them.

Qadri was named in financing “Love Jihad” operations and was involved in multiple criminal activities. Notably, Anwar Qadri had given lakhs of rupees to his two henchmen, Sahil Sheikh and Altaf Khan, to trap Hindu girls, and then later convert them to Islam after marrying them. Sahil admitted that he was given Rs 2 lakh to marry a Hindu girl. At the same time, Altaf also admitted that he too had received Rs 1 lakh. The councillor had promised to give the remaining amount after ‘the work’ was completed. A video of the statements of both is also going viral.

In 2023, a similar Islamic conversion ring was busted involving one Illyas Qureshi. The matter came to light after the case of an 8-year-old Jain boy’s forced circumcision sparked outrage. After circumcising the boy, they created fake documents with a Muslim name and showing Qureshi as his real father.

Back then, the police had said that a whole racket of religious conversion was collaborating with Ilyas Qureshi.

Rape, threats, forced conversions to Islam and perpetual abuse by rape jihadis in Uttar Pradesh: Locations change, modus remains the same

Western Uttar Pradesh has been a hotbed of grooming jihad and other Islamist crimes. In 2020, the Kanpur Police formed a Special Investigation Team after several cases of forced conversions of Hindu women to Islam on the pretext of marriage were reported from the city, especially from Kanpur’s Juhi Colony.

In November 2020, the SIT submitted its report to the Kanpur range inspector general, after probing 14 cases lodged in the police stations across the Kanpur district over the last year. Out of 14 cases, the SIT probed 11 criminal cases. In one case, one Fateh Khan pretended to be Aryan Mehrotra to trap a 14-year-old Hindu girl in Kanpur’s Gopal Nagar. The Muslim perpetrator befriended the minor Hindu girl, raped and assaulted her and threatened to harm her parents. The SIT report also revealed that Fateh Khan pressured the victim to convert to Islam and got her Aadhar card made in the name of Mariyam Fatima. The rape jihadi was booked under the POCSO Act alongside other relevant provisions.

In another case, a Muslim man named Mohammed Ubais, aka Babu, posed as a Hindu to entrap a 16-year-old minor Hindu girl. Ubais, with the help of his sister, Mahi Hayat Khan. The accused, along with his sister, tried to brainwash and pressure the minor victim to adopt Islam. The girl was rescued by her mother, and the accused was sent to jail.

Similar cases involving Muslim perpetrators targeting Hindu girls from Naubasta, Govindnagar, Babu Purwa, Chakeri, and Juhi Colony were detailed in the SIT report. In most of these cases, a common modus operandi was found. The Muslim perpetrators would make contact with gullible Hindu girls, befriend them, ensnare them into their love trap, sexually exploit them, record obscene videos and take pictures, threaten and blackmail them, and force them into converting to Islam.

In all 11 cases the SIT probed, they found certain transgressions based on which the accused were arrested and sent to jail. Pertinently, in 7 of these 11 cases, the victims were minors.

Back in 2020, it was reported that a Hindu girl named Shalini Yadav, who went missing, was found after two months; however, she had converted to Islam and became Fiza Fatima. Shalini Yadav (Fiza Fatima) uploaded a video on Facebook, eloping from her house and telling the story of converting to Islam and getting married to Mohammad Faisal. Shalini’s brother, however, called this a case of love jihad and alleged that a grooming gang was active in the Juhi Colony.

In 2020, it was reported that in just two months, 5 girls ran away from their homes in the Kanpur area with Muslim men. Other than Shalini Yadav, two sisters, residents of Awas Vikas, Kalyanpur, fled with the accused Shahrukh and another Muslim youth, both residents of Juhi Colony. Similarly, a girl and her younger sister, both residents of Panki Ratanpur Colony, accused Mohammad Mohsin. The case came to light when the younger sister understood the game plan of the Muslim perpetrators.

Beyond individual cases of love jihad, organised Islamic conversion rackets pose an unavoidable threat to India’s demography and Hinduism

While this discussion so far must have been alarming, however, we have not even included individual cases of love jihad, which are rampant across the country. Individual cases of Muslim men targeting Hindu and other non-Muslim women for sexual abuse and forced conversion further worsen the situation.

These individual cases also involve similar modus operandi: befriend, lure into love trap by either posing as a Hindu man or a pretending to a ‘secular-progressive’ Muslim, establish sexual relations by promising marriage, record obscene visuals and use the same to blackmail the Hindu victims, force feed them beef, coerce them into converting to Islam and marrying the Muslim perpetrator. A refusal to comply would either result in the victim’s murder or loss of reputation in society.

The cases discussed above point to a consistent toolkit of sexual harassment, blackmail, forced conversions, and the use of foreign funding by organised Islamist networks to execute this toolkit. Exploiting vulnerabilities of their Hindu targets, Muslim grooming gangs and conversion rackets are operating across the country, ruining the lives of Hindu and other non-Muslim women and men, taking steps towards modifying the demography of India.

While the Christian missionaries and Pentecostal pastors harvest souls for Christianity by offering financial inducements, giving food grains, and promising to ‘miraculously’ heal diseases, Islamic rape jihadis and conversion rings rely on feigning love, sexual exploitation, coercion and brainwashing to convert their Hindu targets to Islam. It is no hyperbole that the Hindus and their religious-cultural identity are facing a two-front war.

Ironically, while Islamic conversion rackets, from Jamaluddin alias Chhangur Baba to ISIS-linked Kerala cases, are specifically targeting the Hindus and destabilising the Hindu-majority India’s social fabric, anyone criticising them is labelled Islamophobic.

In fact, such cases are downplayed by the Islamo-leftist cabal as either exceptions or responded with a deliberate silence by the ‘secular’ politicians and their supportive ecosystem.

While astonishing, these cases involving organised Islamic conversion rackets backed by structured incentives, foreign funding, Hindu-hating jihadist motivations and a whitewashing propaganda machinery at its disposal, have been rampant in the country for many years. These are not mere crimes but an orchestrated threat to India’s demography, religious harmony and national security.

India owes its secular character to the Hindu majority, with the Hindus under threat, India’s soul is under threat. There are many Islamist ‘Chhangur Babas’ lurking around in the country.

OpIndia,15/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/ghost-students-fake-schools-rs-57-lakh-vanished-the-mp-scholarship-scam/,"Ghost students, fake schools, including madrasas, and Rs 57 lakh vanished: All you need to know about the MP Minority Scholarship Scam","A major scholarship scam worth over ₹57 lakh has emerged in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, where more than 40 educational institutions (23 private schools and 17 madrasas) allegedly siphoned off government funds using fake or ineligible students. The scam exploited a Central Government scholarship scheme (Pre/Post-Matric Minority Scholarship Scheme) for minority students with ₹5,700 annual grants.

On 17th June, 2025, the scam came to light when the Backwards Classes and Minority Welfare Board filed a formal complaint with the Bhopal Police. The complaint was submitted in coordination with the Union Ministry of Minority Affairs, alleging misuse of the scholarship scheme.

Anatomy of a scam

According to the investigation done by NDTV, there are multiple ghost institutions that only run on paper, with fabricated student records. One school in the Jahangirabad locality claimed ₹1.65 lakh for 29 non-existent students. According to the locals, “That board of “City Montessori School” has been up for two years, but no school ever opened”. Similar scenes unfolded at Amberly House School, now replaced by clinics and shops. At MJ Convent, investigators found posters for Class 10 toppers but none for senior grades and the staff of St. D’Souza Convent fled when asked about missing Class 11–12 students.

Schools that are approved only for classes 1-8 or 10 also fraudulently apply for scholarships for Classes 11–12. The money was transferred using shell accounts. Funds were routed to bank accounts of operators’ relatives or contacts, not students. The money was withdrawn immediately after disbursal. Applications bypassed scrutiny through MP Online’s scholarship portal by uploading fake documents with manipulated data. The nodal officers’ rubber stamp was also used without verification.

Systemic collusion

According to the FIR, 972 fake students across 40 institutions in Bhopal point to institutionalised corruption. They shared fake addresses with multiple schools running from a single building.

The government officials showed pure negligence as Nodal officers forwarded applications without physical checks. The fraud was exposed after the Union Ministry of Minority Affairs flagged discrepancies in student records. The fraud is not limited to Bhopal. 104 institutions across Madhya Pradesh are now under scrutiny for similar violations.

Political fallout

Minister of State for Backward Classes and Minority Welfare Krishna Gaur distanced herself from the time frame of this case and said, “This scam is from before my tenure. However, we have started a departmental inquiry, and I will personally ensure that strict action is taken against the culprits. No one has the right to usurp the scholarship amount of the students. The government is committed to the welfare of the minority and backward classes.

Legal action

Crime Branch officials have begun questioning school operators and directors of the involved institutions. They are also collecting documentation from education authorities at the district and state levels. The FIR has been registered under the sections of cheating, forgery, criminal breach of trust, and misappropriation of public funds.",major scholarship scam worth ₹57 lakh emerged bhopal madhya pradesh 40 educational institution 23 private school 17 madrasa allegedly siphoned government fund using fake ineligible student scam exploited central government scholarship scheme pre post matric minority scholarship scheme minority student ₹5 700 annual grant 17th june 2025 scam came light backwards class minority welfare board filed formal complaint bhopal police complaint submitted coordination union ministry minority affair alleging misuse scholarship scheme anatomy scam according investigation done ndtv multiple ghost institution run paper fabricated student record one school jahangirabad locality claimed ₹1 65 lakh 29 non existent student according local “that board “city montessori school” two year school ever opened” similar scene unfolded amberly house school replaced clinic shop mj convent investigator found poster class 10 topper none senior grade staff st d’souza convent fled asked missing class 11–12 student school approved class 1 8 10 also fraudulently apply scholarship class 11–12 money transferred using shell account fund routed bank account operators’ relative contact student money withdrawn immediately disbursal application bypassed scrutiny mp online’s scholarship portal uploading fake document manipulated data nodal officers’ rubber stamp also used without verification systemic collusion according fir 972 fake student across 40 institution bhopal point institutionalised corruption shared fake address multiple school running single building government official showed pure negligence nodal officer forwarded application without physical check fraud exposed union ministry minority affair flagged discrepancy student record fraud limited bhopal 104 institution across madhya pradesh scrutiny similar violation political fallout minister state backward class minority welfare krishna gaur distanced time frame case said “this scam tenure however started departmental inquiry personally ensure strict action taken culprit one right usurp scholarship amount student government committed welfare minority backward class legal action crime branch official begun questioning school operator director involved institution also collecting documentation education authority district state level fir registered section cheating forgery criminal breach trust misappropriation public fund
OpIndia,15/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/pib-fake-news-samosa-jalebi-health-warning-cigarettes-media-news/,Fake claim: PIB calls out false media reports that union health ministry is set to issue health warning for samosa and jalebi like they...,"Many Indian media outlets, including Times of India and NDTV, recently published a news story alleging that popular Indian snacks and sweets such as samosa, jalebi and laddoo will be served alongside a health warning akin to those on cigarette packets. Furthermore, the new development was attributed to the Union Ministry of Health that it has been done in order to tackle health issues.

On 15th July, PIB fact-check, however, refuted the claims as false. It emphasized that the ministry’s advisory does not include any warning labels on food items sold by vendors and “has not been selective towards Indian snacks.”

Additionally, it clarified that the general recommendation is not unique to any one food product but rather serves as a “behavioural nudge” to alert consumers to “hidden fats and excess sugar in all food products.”

✅The general advisory is a behavioural nudge to make people aware of hidden fats and excess sugar in all food products, and not specifically to any particular food product.



The advisory is for healthier options and initiatives at workplaces and urges people to make healthier… pic.twitter.com/gD3f2XOeTF — PIB Fact Check (@PIBFactCheck) July 15, 2025

The agency added that the suggestion encourages “people to make healthier” decisions to reduce unnecessary sugar and oil in favour of a healthy diet and way of life as well as supports healthier workplace options and activities. “It does not target India’s rich street food culture,” it further pointed out.

What is in the letter

The ministry’s official letter identified “sharp rise in obesity in both children and adults” as a significant concern. It informed, “As per NFHS-5 (2019-21), over one in five adults in urban areas are overweight or obese. Prevalence of childhood obesity is impacted by poor dietary habits and reduced physical activity.”

It added, “As per The Lancet GBD 2021 obesity forecasting study, published in 2025, the number of overweight and obese adults in India is projected to rise from 18 crores in 2021 to 44.9 crores by 2050, making it the country with the second-highest global burden.” It stated that obesity dramatically increases the risk of non-communicable diseases like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease and several types of cancer.

The ministry pointed out, “It also affects mental health, mobility, and quality of life, and imposes a heavy economic burden through increased healthcare costs and productivity losses. Early prevention and health promotion are critical to reversing these trends.”

The letter outlined that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made a strong case for changing people’s lifestyles in order to fight obesity. “At the Opening Ceremony of the 38th National Games in Dehradun on 28th January 2025, Hon’ble Prime Minister invoked the Fit India Campaign and urged citizens to adopt active, healthy lifestyles as part of the broader vision of a Swasth Bharat. In his Mann Ki Baat, he called for a 10% reduction in oil consumption,” the official communiqué read.

It then conveyed, “In response to this national appeal, and as part of the ministry’s flagship initiatives under the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases (NP-NCD), it is imperative to promote sustainable behavioural changes in our workplaces. These include reducing excessive consumption of oil and sugar, both of which are key contributors to rising rates of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and other lifestyle-related disorders.”

According to the letter, it is advocating that Sugar and Oil Boards be displayed as an effort to encourage better eating practices in multiple settings. They will function as visual behavioural cues in public spaces like offices and schools, revealing important details including hidden sugars and fats in common food items.

Hence, a direction to all “departments/offices/autonomous bodies and other public institutions/organizations” under the ministry was sought.

OpIndia,15/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/madras-high-court-petitioner-fathima-chenna-malleeswarar-and-chenna-kesava-temples/,Madras High Court slams petitioner Fathima for filing multiple frivolous applications to delay the legal proceedings in a case relating to temple properties,"The Madras High Court recently reprimanded a petitioner, Fathima Nachia, for filing consecutive frivolous applications to delay the legal proceedings in a case relating to the properties of temples located in Chennai.

According to the New Indian Express, on 8th July, a bench of Justice A D Jagadish Chandira dismissed the petition filed by Fathima, which challenged the execution proceedings in a case which was decreed in favour of the twin temples of Chenna Malleeswarar and Chenna Kesava Perumal Devasthanam, Chennai. The decree allowed the twin temples to recover their properties, which were leased out to her husband, Mohammad Iqbal.

In 1994, the temples had filed suits against Iqbal for default in payment of rent, seeking delivery of possession and rent arrears. In 2000, an ex-parte decree was passed in favour of the temples allowing them to recover the rent arrears and the possession of the properties.

However, the proceedings for the execution of the decree began in 2015. Fathima’s husband passed away pending the execution of the decree. For the entire duration, Fathima continued to enjoy the tenancy rights of her husband and later on chose to challenge the execution proceedings of the decree, instead of the decree itself.

The High Court slammed Fathima for adopting dilatory tactics

The High Court saw through the petitioner’s dilatory tactics and said, “While on one side, the revision petitioner contends that the ex parte decree being a non speaking order is not at all valid in the eye of law, she has not chosen to challenge the same even after having the knowledge about such a decree. She had taken almost 24 years from the date of decree to seek for setting aside the same and at least about 9 years after she had filed a suit in O.S.No.2665 of 2015 seeking for permanent injunction against the respondent-temple, which shows her intention to protract the proceeding by one way or other.”

“While the revision petitioner claims lack of knowledge about the eviction proceedings initiated by the respondent-temple, she had chosen to muddle the issue by filing petitions, one after another, without filing any petition to set aside the ex-parte decree and ultimately, she had filed petitions only in the year 2024 with a delay of 8456 days, which were also dismissed on merits. Thereby, it is evident that she adopts a dilatory tactics to prevent the respondent temple from enjoying the fruits of the decree by fermenting litigation,” the Judge noted in the judgment, which was accessed by OpIndia.

Court bound to protect interests of the deity: HC

Fathima challenged the decree on the ground that the petition on behalf of the temple was filed by the managing trustee of the temple, who, according to her, did not have the locus standi, instead of the Hindu Religious & Charitable Endowments Department. Additionally, she claimed that the execution petition was barred by limitation because it was filed after a long delay.

The High Court expressed strong disapproval over her contentions and said that it would not be appropriate to deny the temples the benefit of exemption from limitation under section 109 of the HR&CE Act for recovering the properties and the rent arrears solely due to some delay in the execution of the decree, which was already granted in their favour.

Regarding the issue of locus standi raised by the petitioner, the High Court said, “It is a settled principle that any person who is interested in the temple is entitled to initiate law into motion and the court itself, as parens patriae, is bound to protect the interest of the idol.”

Perumal Devasthanam is a historical temple

The Chenna Malleeswarar and Chenna Kesava Perumal Devasthanam temples are together called as the Perumal Devasthanam. These twin temples in Chennai are dedicated to Lord Vishnu (Chenna Keshava) and Lord Shiva (Chenna Malleeswara).

He touched the water at 3.01 PM IST on Tuesday, July 15. A brief thud was felt by the four astronauts while concluding the 18-day space mission. As the drogue parachutes on the Dragon spacecraft deployed, the four astronauts passed through a moment of joy.

“Ax-4 crew are on track to re-enter Earth’s atmosphere and splash down off the coast of San Diego… Dragon will also announce its arrival with a brief sonic boom before splashing down in the Pacific Ocean,” SpaceX said Tuesday.

Ground teams were continuously monitoring Grace, the Dragon capsule, Shukla, and other astronauts who were traveling in. They were continuously given multiple “go”, “no-go” commands until the de-orbit burn, scheduled for around 2.07 pm.

The smooth splash also highlights the conclusion of a nearly 22-hour return journey after the spacecraft undocked from the ISS on Monday evening IST. Shukla, along with his crewmates- Commander Peggy Whiston, Slawosz Uznanski, and Tibor Kapu experienced extreme heat and g-forces while Dragon streaked through Earth’s atmosphere at over 27,000 km/h.

Shukla became India’s space hero and the country’s first astronaut to visit the International Space Station and concluding the historic Axiom-4 (AX-4) mission.

How was the mission beneficial for India?

After Rakesh Sharma’s 1984 mission, Shubhanshu Shukla became the first India to orbit aboard the ISS and the second Indian to travel into space. His international collaboration in this mission is regarded as a major leap forward in India’s human spaceflight journey and a step ahead to the country’s upcoming Gaganyaan mission.

His participation and selection in the mission was crucial in multiple ways as he took part in multiple global science experiments across fields like biology, material science, and artificial intelligence. His association in the sprouts project like studying plant growth in microgravity holds rays of hope for sustainable space farming.

He is also expected to work on experiments related to cellular health, muscle degeneration, and autonomous robotics, research that could impact both future space missions and Earth-based science.

Adding to this, his scientific contribution and professionalism throughout the project have gained widespread attention and national pride. Commander Peggy Whitson praised his professionalism and adaptability on the maiden spaceflight.

A landmark history for India

Shukla’s alignment in the Axiom (AX-4) mission provides ISRO a real-world experience in human spaceflight operations, an experience that will cover all aspects of Gaganyaan’s planning and execution.

Shukla’s successful 18-day stay in orbit will aid Indian teams in gaining practical understanding of microgravity, spacecraft operations, crew health monitoring, and post-mission rehabilitation.

ISRO has also invested approximately Rs 500 crore in supporting Shukla’s AX-4 flight, viewing it as both a technical trial and a training ground for Gaganyaan’s future crew.

Former ISRO officials and space experts have emphasized that hands-on experience aboard the ISS is vastly different from satellite launches or remote, ground-based simulations, making Shukla’s mission a crucial milestone.

The scientific experiments he carried out with Indian principal investigators and homegrown technologies not only contribute to global research but also enhance India’s capabilities in pursuing future space station projects and lunar exploration.

Following retrieval, Shukla and the crew will undergo medical evaluations and participate in a week-long rehabilitation program to help their bodies readjust to Earth’s gravity. Shubhanshu Shukla’s safe return marks the conclusion of a landmark chapter in India’s space journey one that shattered barriers, set new records, and laid the groundwork for India’s human spaceflight ambitions in the decades ahead.",moment sigh experienced india captain shubhanshu shukla successfully splashed pacific ocean coast san diego touched water 3 01 pm ist tuesday july 15 brief thud felt four astronaut concluding 18 day space mission drogue parachute dragon spacecraft deployed four astronaut passed moment joy “ax 4 crew track enter earth’s atmosphere splash coast san diego… dragon also announce arrival brief sonic boom splashing pacific ocean ” spacex said tuesday dragon’s four main parachute deployed pic twitter com ogfrfqcymb — spacex spacex july 15 2025 ground team continuously monitoring grace dragon capsule shukla astronaut traveling continuously given multiple “go” “no go” command de orbit burn scheduled around 2 07 pm smooth splash also highlight conclusion nearly 22 hour return journey spacecraft undocked iss monday evening ist shukla along crewmates commander peggy whiston slawosz uznanski tibor kapu experienced extreme heat g force dragon streaked earth’s atmosphere 27 000 km h shukla became india’s space hero country’s first astronaut visit international space station concluding historic axiom 4 ax 4 mission mission beneficial india rakesh sharma’s 1984 mission shubhanshu shukla became first india orbit aboard iss second indian travel space international collaboration mission regarded major leap forward india’s human spaceflight journey step ahead country’s upcoming gaganyaan mission dragon’s second human spaceflight mission splash coast california fram2 returned dragon recovery operation west coast past april pic twitter com ztpmb2k2jc — spacex spacex july 15 2025 participation selection mission crucial multiple way took part multiple global science experiment across field like biology material science artificial intelligence association sprout project like studying plant growth microgravity hold ray hope sustainable space farming also expected work experiment related cellular health muscle degeneration autonomous robotics research could impact future space mission earth based science adding scientific contribution professionalism throughout project gained widespread attention national pride commander peggy whitson praised professionalism adaptability maiden spaceflight landmark history india shukla’s alignment axiom ax 4 mission provides isro real world experience human spaceflight operation experience cover aspect gaganyaan’s planning execution shukla’s successful 18 day stay orbit aid indian team gaining practical understanding microgravity spacecraft operation crew health monitoring post mission rehabilitation isro also invested approximately r 500 crore supporting shukla’s ax 4 flight viewing technical trial training ground gaganyaan’s future crew former isro official space expert emphasized hand experience aboard iss vastly different satellite launch remote ground based simulation making shukla’s mission crucial milestone scientific experiment carried indian principal investigator homegrown technology contribute global research also enhance india’s capability pursuing future space station project lunar exploration following retrieval shukla crew undergo medical evaluation participate week long rehabilitation program help body readjust earth’s gravity shubhanshu shukla’s safe return mark conclusion landmark chapter india’s space journey one shattered barrier set new record laid groundwork india’s human spaceflight ambition decade ahead

India has achieved the target five years ahead of the 2030 target under the Paris Agreement. Joshi termed the achievement a “historic green leap” in a post on X and credited Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership for steering the country’s green transformation.

In a world seeking climate solutions, India is showing the way.



Achieving 50% non-fossil fuel capacity five years ahead of the 2030 target is a proud moment for every Indian.

As of July 2025, India’s total installed power capacity stands at 484.8 GW, out of which 242.8 GW now comes from non-fossil sources. 184.6 GW comes from renewables, 49.2 GW from large hydro, and 8.7 GW from nuclear energy.

Fulfilling a global commitment ahead of time

India’s non-fossil achievement, which is a core part of its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), has greater significance despite India having among the lowest per capita emissions globally. The Union Ministry said this reinforces India’s standing as a global clean energy leader and sends a strong signal of its commitment to sustainable development.

The Ministry added, “Economic growth and environmental stewardship are not mutually exclusive. By achieving this milestone well before 2030, India has shown that it is possible to pursue both together.”

Policy, technology and equity driving the shift

Flagship initiatives like PM-KUSUM and the PM Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana have played a vital role in India’s achievement, as these programmes empowered rural households and farmers through decentralised solar solutions. Furthermore, the push for solar parks, bioenergy, and hybrid renewable policies provides a solid ground for India’s green transition.

Notably, the government has also been investing in energy storage systems to ensure stability as renewable sources grow. In February this year, the Central Electricity Authority advised co-locating energy storage with solar projects to improve efficiency and grid reliability.

AI and digitalisation to shape the future

Artificial Intelligence is also expected to underpin future energy infrastructure. AI will enable intelligent energy marketplaces, smart meters, and demand-side management, which will transform consumers into ‘prosumers’. However, the Ministry has warned that cybersecurity must be a priority as digital dependence rises in the sector.",14th july union minister new renewable energy pralhad joshi announced india achieved 50 total installed power capacity non fossil fuel source india achieved target five year ahead 2030 target paris agreement joshi termed achievement “historic green leap” post x credited prime minister narendra modi’s leadership steering country’s green transformation world seeking climate solution india showing way achieving 50 non fossil fuel capacity five year ahead 2030 target proud moment every indian hon ble pm shri narendramodi ji’s leadership continues drive bharat’s green transformation — paving… pic twitter com ydzwerwqnc — pralhad joshi joshipralhad july 14 2025 july 2025 india’s total installed power capacity stand 484 8 gw 242 8 gw come non fossil source 184 6 gw come renewables 49 2 gw large hydro 8 7 gw nuclear energy fulfilling global commitment ahead time india’s non fossil achievement core part nationally determined contribution ndcs greater significance despite india among lowest per caput emission globally union ministry said reinforces india’s standing global clean energy leader sends strong signal commitment sustainable development ministry added “economic growth environmental stewardship mutually exclusive achieving milestone well 2030 india shown possible pursue together ” policy technology equity driving shift flagship initiative like pm kusum pm surya ghar muft bijli yojana played vital role india’s achievement programme empowered rural household farmer decentralised solar solution furthermore push solar park bioenergy hybrid renewable policy provides solid ground india’s green transition notably government also investing energy storage system ensure stability renewable source grow february year central electricity authority advised co locating energy storage solar project improve efficiency grid reliability ai digitalisation shape future artificial intelligence also expected underpin future energy infrastructure ai enable intelligent energy marketplace smart meter demand side management transform consumer ‘prosumers’ however ministry warned cybersecurity must priority digital dependence rise sector

The victim, named Soumyashree Bisi, suffered over 90% burns and was getting medical care at AIIMS, Bhubaneswar.

A statement issued by the Department of Burn Centre, AIIMS, Bhubaneswar, on 14th July, said that the victim was admitted on 12th July after being referred from the Balasore District Headquarters Hospital. The hospital said that she received all possible intensive care, including IV support, antibiotics, mechanical ventilation, and renal therapy, but succumbed to her injuries on the night of 14th July. “She was declared clinically dead at 11:46 PM on July 14,” the hospital confirmed.

Somyashree Bisi, who was pursuing B.Ed. at Fakir Mohan Autonomous College in Balasore, had accused a Head of Department (HoD), Samir Kumar Sahu, of sexual harassment on 1st July. On Saturday, she had a meeting with the college principal, Dilip Kumar Ghosh, shortly after which she set herself on fire. Somyashree Bisi, who was reportedly associated with the ABVP, had submitted formal complaints to the college principal and the police against Sahu. She was disappointed as no substantial action was taken on her complaints.

An internal committee was formed to inquire into her allegations. In a letter submitted to the committee, she had provided details of the abuse and threats by the HoD, which reportedly went on for months. She was promised action within seven days, but nothing happened. The victim was upset with the sheer inaction by authorities amid threats and harassment by the HoD. The victim’s father blamed the college principal, Ghosh, for the death of his daughter. Her mother has demanded capital punishment for the culprits.

As per reports, batchmates of the victim revealed that she was mentally distressed for weeks because of continuous harassment by Sahu. They alleged that Sahu repeatedly made inappropriate demands and threatened her with academic consequences if she did not comply. On 12th July, the victim and some other students sat on a protest outside the college gate. Fellow students reportedly said that, on the day of the incident, Somyashree Bisi suddenly got up and ran to an area close to the principal’s office and set herself on fire. She was rushed to the Balasore District Headquarters Hospital with severe burns, from where she was referred to AIIMS, Bhubaneswar.

CM Manjhi assured strict action against culprits

Odisha Chief Minister Mohan Charan Majhi expressed his grief over the incident and assured the victim’s family that the strictest punishment will be given to the culprits.

This comes after the firm deposited ₹4,843.58 crore in an escrow account, as directed by SEBI following serious allegations of market manipulation.

According to a reports, SEBI has confirmed that the specified amount has been credited to the account with a lien in the regulator’s favour. Jane Street has now formally appealed to SEBI to relax certain conditions laid out in the interim order, stating that it has fulfilled the financial compliance required under the directive. The appeal is currently under review, with SEBI assuring that the matter is being handled in line with due process while maintaining the integrity of the Indian securities market.

Why has SEBI banned Jane Street

This entire controversy erupted after SEBI launched a detailed investigation into the trading behaviour of Jane Street Group in India. The regulator concluded that the firm was not just making high profits, but was actively manipulating the market to its advantage.

According to SEBI’s 105-page interim order, Jane Street had raked in massive profits of ₹43,289 crore through index options trading while intentionally booking losses of around ₹7,208 crore in cash equities and futures trading. The motive? To influence market prices in a way that benefited their positions in the derivatives market.

The key strategy used by Jane Street was called “Intra-Day Index Manipulation”. This tactic involved aggressively buying Nifty Bank stocks and futures in the morning sessions to drive up the index. Later in the day, they would aggressively sell off these same positions to bring the index down, at times close to market closing. This deliberate movement created price fluctuations that favoured their massive options positions, especially near expiry dates.

This kind of trading pattern is known as “marking the close”, a manipulative practice where traders push prices up or down near the end of a trading session to benefit their derivative holdings. SEBI said Jane Street took this to an extreme scale, making it “prima facie manipulative” given the volume and timing of their trades.

How the matter came out

SEBI’s investigation showed that Jane Street operated across different segments, including cash equities, stock futures, index futures, and index options. The company would accept losses in stocks and futures to ensure gains in options.

The manipulation mainly happened on days when index options were about to expire. On these days, Jane Street would build large risk positions and manipulate the underlying index to move in a direction favourable to their options trades.

The firm’s Indian arm, JSI Investments Private Ltd, played a crucial role in this. It was involved in heavy trading of index constituent stocks, with no clear financial rationale except to move the market in Jane Street’s favour. These trades allowed them to mislead other investors, who reacted to the artificial price movements, unaware of the manipulation behind the scenes.

The impact of this strategy was significant. While other traders made decisions based on what they believed were real market movements, Jane Street was quietly pulling the strings to profit from the chaos it created.

How much profit did Jane Street make through this scandal

The SEBI probe revealed that Jane Street made total profits of ₹36,502 crore through this manipulation. Of this, around ₹32,681 crore came through foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) linked to the Jane Street group. The regulator also noted that the profits were “significantly higher than the average quantum of assets held by these FPIs in India,” raising red flags about the size and intent of the trades.

Jane Street’s Indian unit, JSI Investments, appeared to have no purpose other than to facilitate these trades. SEBI observed that their daily trading activities lacked legitimate economic reasoning and seemed purely focused on influencing the Nifty Bank index.

A landmark case in Indian markets

This case is being seen as one of the most significant regulatory actions taken by SEBI against a foreign trading entity, as the Indian retail investors saw substantial losses of Rs 1.05 lakh crore in derivatives trading in FY25, according to recent SEBI data. It now sends a strong message to overseas trading companies looking to manipulate markets in India.

The result of this case may have far-reaching effects on the way SEBI treats foreign portfolio investors, particularly those with high-frequency and large-scale algorithmic trading strategies. As of now, all eyes are on SEBI’s final decision and whether Jane Street will be allowed to resume its trading activities in India.

OpIndia,14/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/bvn-schools-under-inquiry-guru-purnima-celebrations-edu-minister-initiates-inquiry-know-what-happened/,"Hindu traditions under attack in Kerala? Schools booked for Guru Purnima celebrations, Education Minister orders probe: Know what happened","On 10th July some private schools participated in a series of “Pada Pooja” (foot-worship) ceremonies as part of the Guru Purnima celebrations which triggered political controversy in Kerala. Students kneeled, washed the feet of teachers including retired staff and offered flowers as a symbolic act of respect during the Vyasa Jayanti festivities. The event was observed in institutions affiliated with the Bharatiya Vidya Niketan.

Governor Rajendra Vishwanath Arlekar vigorously defended the practice as an aspect of Indian culture, while the Director of Public Instruction (DPI) was instructed by General Education Minister V Sivankutty to demand clarification from the schools.

He claimed that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) is using the governor as leverage to advance its backward policies, which are intended to instill a slave mindset among the pupils. The development turned into yet another confrontation between the Raj Bhavan and the Left government.

The minister expressed that even if the government’s authority to take action against unassisted school administration was limited, they depend on a government No Objection Certificate (NOC) to run. The DPI’s report, which is anticipated in a week, is going to be used by the government to determine the course of action.

Attacks on RSS, Governor

V Sivankutty termed the rituals as anti-democratic and incompatible with contemporary educational ideals. He threatened to take severe measures against institutions that disregard educational standards and instructed the Director of General Education to produce a report.

“It is unfortunate that someone holding the position of governor would make such statements. I would like to know which particular text related to Indian culture celebrates the practice of students washing the feet of their teachers. We are issuing directions to all the school authorities that no student studying in any school in Kerala should be made to wash the feet of teachers or anyone else,” he stated during a program on 13th July. He added that the state’s culture is not accustomed to the kinds of practices being promoted by the RSS.

According to MV Govindan, state secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), the RSS is trying to resurrect a feudal-era custom which was abandoned centuries ago, to further its goal of enforcing the Chaturvarnya (caste system).

He declared, “We are not against respecting teachers, but that should not be an excuse to revive such feudalistic practices. Students were even made to wash the feet of RSS leaders. It is part of an RSS agenda to erode Kerala’s secular and democratic fabric. The secular society of Kerala has to unitedly oppose this.”

KC Venugopal, general secretary of the All India Congress Committee claimed that by supporting such activities, the governor is trying to drag Kerala society back to the prehistoric era. He remarked, “Such a Governor is a shame for progressive Kerala.”

Leftist organisations outrage

The ceremony took place in Kasaragod, Kannur and Alappuzha as well as Vivekananda Vidya Peedom in Mavelikara reported a similar incident, in which students conducted the ceremony for Anoop, the district secretary of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

Videos of the rituals swiftly went viral, prompting angry reaction from leftist outfits including the Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI), Balasangham, and the Student Federation of India (SFI), who called the practice “degrading” and “regressive.” They alleged that the organisers were trying to introduce Sangh Parivar ideology into educational settings.

According to the DYFI, pupils at the Cheemeni school washed the feet of hundreds of teachers and declared, “Though these brahmanical rituals were conducted in RSS-backed schools, it is a matter of shame for our state.” Furthermore, on 14th July, the DYFI planned a statewide demonstration against these activities in educational establishments.

SFI state president M Sivaprasad contended, “The incident demands strong condemnation and legal action as it reflects an attempt to impose the RSS-backed Chaturvarnya system in Kerala.” SFI state committee submitted a formal complaint to V Sivankutty. The same was forwarded to the Kerala State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (KSCPCR) by the group after which a case was lauched.

“We noticed similar practices taking place in other institutions after receiving the initial complaint about Saraswathy Vidyalaya, Bandadka. The commission has asked the state police to submit a report,” informed Mohanakumar B who spoke to The News Minute. He is the member in charge of Kasaragod district. The body also requested thorough reports from Badudka and Bekal police officials.

Governor, school adminsitration defends the practice

During an event held in Balaramapuram by the Hindu organisation Balagokulam, the governor stated, “Guru puja is part of our culture, where we offer flowers at the feet of our gurus. But some people have objected to it. I don’t understand which culture these people come from.”

He also pointed out the value of “honouring teachers” and underlined that gurus are “great souls” who “deserve respect” and added, “If we forget our culture, we forget ourselves, we’ll be nowhere in this world.”

The headmistress of the Bandadka school, PT Uma, argued that the rite was a part of the traditional “Vyasa Jayanthi” occasion. She voiced, “The feet of the honourable invitees were washed by teachers themselves. Students only offered flowers at their feet. Our children received blessings from the guests through these acts.”

She mentioned that students are urged to touch their feet of their parents every morning and holds the view that the lack of such practices in their lives could contribute to drug use and unethical behavior.

Moreover, Rajeevan, a representative of the Vidyalaya Samithi, a group of parents and teachers of Vivekananda School in Cheemeni, also defended the same and emphasised that it was an element of the ancient and sacred Sanatana Dharma. Any opposition to the same will be “unitedly resisted,” he highlighted.

OpIndia,14/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/around-51-lakh-voters-to-be-removed-from-bihar-voter-list-as-eci-finds-major-discrepancies/,"Around 51 lakh voters to be removed from Bihar voter list as ECI finds major discrepancies in SIR exercise due to duplicate entries, death...","The Election Commission of India (ECI) has found major differences in the voter roll of Bihar through a special verification campaign referred to as the Special Intensive Revision (SIR). The ECI reported that approximately 18 lakh enrolled voters have died, 26 lakh have shifted, and 7 lakh names are duplicates.

The ECI revealed that nearly 97.30% of Bihar’s total 7.89 crore voters have completed the enumeration forms till now. That is more than 7.68 crore voters have already replied.

Officers such as the Chief Electoral Officer (CEO), District Election Officers (DEOs), Electoral Registration Officers (EROs), and Booth Level Officers (BLOs) are coordinating with political party workers to sanitize the voters’ list. The ECI has also published a list of 21.36 lakh voters whose forms are yet to be submitted, and approximately 52.30 lakh names of individuals who are deceased, have migrated permanently, or are listed in more than one location.

The ECI further stated that the BLOs and EROs are providing detailed lists of such voters to all political parties so that the process remains transparent. The people will be allowed a complete one-month period in order to object to or make corrections on names being added or removed from the voter list.

Opposition raises concerns

But the Opposition is strongly criticising this exercise. Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has charged the NDA alliance with attempting to delete names of people from the voter roll. She complained that voter rolls were inflated in Maharashtra elections, and now, voters are being deleted in Bihar in the guise of revision.

She stated, “Earlier, in Maharashtra, votes were tampered with by padding electoral rolls. Now, in Bihar, efforts are being made to do the same by deleting voters’ names. The ‘vote ban’ under the pretext of SIR is a plot to grab the right to vote given by the Constitution. We oppose every attempt to crush the Constitution.”

SIR exercise in Bihar

The Special Intensive Revision (SIR) is being conducted in Bihar to revise the voters’ lists for the upcoming assembly elections in the state. This kind of intensive revision occurred in the state for the last time in 2003. Due to changes such as urban migration, fatalities, new young voters, and the problem of illegal immigrants, a new verification became necessary.

BLOs have been designated to go to houses and ensure the rolls are correct. The objective is straightforward: to register all legitimate voters, eliminate illegitimate ones, and maintain transparency in the procedure.

The elections for the Bihar Assembly are scheduled later in the year sometime around October or November, but the official release date has not been declared yet.

OpIndia,14/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/1-29-lakh-bigha-land-occupied-by-bangladeshi-infiltrators-and-doubtful-citizens-freed-in-4-years-informs-assam-cm-himanta-biswa-sarma/,"1.29 lakh bigha land occupied by Bangladeshi infiltrators and doubtful citizens freed in 4 years, informs Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma","Chief Minister of Assam, Himanta Biswa Sarma stated that around 29 lakh bighas (nearly 10 lakh acres) of land in Assam is reported to be occupied by “Bangladeshi infiltrators and doubtful citizens.” He mentioned that after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government took office in 2021, a campaign was initiated to reclaim the property but they encountered international pressure to cease these actions.

He made the shocking disclosures on 21st July during a function commemorating the fourth anniversary of the Multipurpose Agricultural Project at Garukhuti in the Darang district.

This project commenced in 2021, and to date, 77,420 bighas of land (25,500 acres) have been cleared of encroachments.

“Today, the land in Garukhuti, once occupied illegally, has been converted into productive agricultural fields. This is the model we aim to replicate across encroached areas in Assam,” he conveyed.

In the last 4 years, we have freed over 42,000 acres of land from encroachers and dedicated it to public use. pic.twitter.com/AaWDKMcNTK — Himanta Biswa Sarma (@himantabiswa) July 21, 2025

According to media reports, Sarma remarked, “After the successful execution of the campaign in the Darang district, the initiative was also extended to Borsola, Lumding, Burhapahar, Pabha, Batadrava, Chapar and Paikan. In the last four years, we have reclaimed 1.29 lakh bigha (around 43,000 acres) of occupied land. A considerable portion of it is now being allocated for forest development and the citizens of the state.”

He declared, “If anyone believes that after two or three campaigns we will be intimidated, not confront them directly and bow down, they are mistaken. The martyrs of the Assam Movement will certainly be avenged.” He mentioned that during the Assam Movement from 1983 to 1985, there was a prevailing sense of defeat and many individuals had “surrendered” to the Congress which changed the political trajectory of the state.

Shankar-Madhav became Shankar-Azan

Sarma pointed out that, at a certain point, we started referring to Shankar-Madhav as Shankar-Azan. Azan Peer will continue to maintain his pivotal role, yet Madhav (Madhavdev) also has his own significant position. It is only then that our “caste” can be preserved. Srimanta Sankardev and Sri Sri Madhavdev are esteemed Vaishnav saints in Assam whereas Azan Peer was a Muslim sage who arrived there from Iraq during the 17th century.

Over 1000 bighas of land cleared in Goalpara

The Himanta government is actively involved in measures to safeguard the state’s demographic composition. As part of the drive, encroached lands have been reclaimed in various locations. On 12th July, an eviction operation took place in the Paikan Reserve Forest located in the Goalpara district. 140 hectares (equivalent to 1038 to 1040 bighas) of forest land had been unlawfully taken over predominantly by Muslims.

Tejas Mariswamy, the Divisional Forest Officer of Goalpara outlined that 1,080 families had built houses in this area. The majority of these individuals were Muslims who had migrated from adjacent regions or Bangladesh. A total of 36 bulldozers were utilized during the action and the region was divided into 6 distinct blocks. Nearly 2,500 to 2,700 structures, including houses and shops were dismantled. Over 1,000 police officers and forest guards were deployed for security purposes.

Mamata Banerjee cries “atrocities on Bengalis”

A war of words broke out on social media between Sarma and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee over the removal of infiltrators and illegal occupation in Assam. She complained that the administration is persecuting the Bengali community in Assam by singling them out, labeling it as the BJP’s divisive agenda.

However, Sarma responded that it is not the Bengalis but rather Muslim infiltrators who are being expelled from Assam. He also referenced a statement from the Supreme Court which characterized infiltration as an external invasion.",chief minister assam himanta biswa sarma stated around 29 lakh bighas nearly 10 lakh acre land assam reported occupied “bangladeshi infiltrator doubtful citizen ” mentioned bharatiya janata party bjp government took office 2021 campaign initiated reclaim property encountered international pressure cease action made shocking disclosure 21st july function commemorating fourth anniversary multipurpose agricultural project garukhuti darang district project commenced 2021 date 77 420 bighas land 25 500 acre cleared encroachment “today land garukhuti occupied illegally converted productive agricultural field model aim replicate across encroached area assam ” conveyed last 4 year freed 42 000 acre land encroacher dedicated public use pic twitter com aawdkmcntk — himanta biswa sarma himantabiswa july 21 2025 according medium report sarma remarked “after successful execution campaign darang district initiative also extended borsola lumding burhapahar pabha batadrava chapar paikan last four year reclaimed 1 29 lakh bigha around 43 000 acre occupied land considerable portion allocated forest development citizen state ” declared “if anyone belief two three campaign intimidated confront directly bow mistaken martyr assam movement certainly avenged ” mentioned assam movement 1983 1985 prevailing sense defeat many individual “surrendered” congress changed political trajectory state shankar madhav became shankar azan sarma pointed certain point started referring shankar madhav shankar azan azan peer continue maintain pivotal role yet madhav madhavdev also significant position “caste” preserved srimanta sankardev sri sri madhavdev esteemed vaishnav saint assam whereas azan peer muslim sage arrived iraq 17th century 1000 bighas land cleared goalpara himanta government actively involved measure safeguard state’s demographic composition part drive encroached land reclaimed various location 12th july eviction operation took place paikan reserve forest located goalpara district 140 hectare equivalent 1038 1040 bighas forest land unlawfully taken predominantly muslim tejas mariswamy divisional forest officer goalpara outlined 1 080 family built house area majority individual muslim migrated adjacent region bangladesh total 36 bulldozer utilized action region divided 6 distinct block nearly 2 500 2 700 structure including house shop dismantled 1 000 police officer forest guard deployed security purpose mamata banerjee cry “atrocities bengalis” war word broke social medium sarma west bengal chief minister mamata banerjee removal infiltrator illegal occupation assam complained administration persecuting bengali community assam singling labeling bjp’s divisive agenda however sarma responded bengali rather muslim infiltrator expelled assam also referenced statement supreme court characterized infiltration external invasion

The resignation came on the opening day of the Monsoon Session of Parliament, catching many by surprise amid a busy legislative agenda. Speculations are rife about the timing of Dhankhar’s resignation, with the opposition claiming that the reasons behind his stepping down may be far deeper than just health reasons.

In his letter to President Droupadi Murmu, Jagdeep Dhankhar invoked Article 67(a) of the Constitution to make his resignation effective immediately. Citing ongoing health challenges, he stated his intention to “prioritise health care and abide by medical advice.”

From the very onset in 2022, Dhankhar’s tenure as Vice President was marked by his vocal criticism of the judiciary, especially on the issues of its overreach and accountability. Being a seasoned lawyer himself and having a background in the Supreme Court and the Rajasthan High Court, Jagdeep Dhankhar consistently raised concerns over the alleged encroachment of the powers of the legislature and executive by the judiciary, arguing that their actions undermined the supremacy of Parliament and the balance of powers as prescribed in the Constitution.

“Judiciary cannot become executive”: When Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar warned the judiciary that its overreach might destabilise governance

Hitting back at the judiciary regarding the overturning of parliamentary amendments to the Constitution in December 2022, VP Jagdeep Dhankhar warned that the judiciary cannot become the legislative or the executive because doing so may destabilise the system of government as a whole.

Dhankhar stated during the eighth LM Singhvi memorial lecture that our judiciary, as one of the important institutions of government, cannot be the executive or legislative.

“The doctrine of separation of power is fundamental to our governance. Any incursion, howsoever subtle, in the domain of the other by one has the capacity or potential to unsettle the apple cart of governance,” then vice president stated.

“India in 2015-16 was dealing with a constitutional amendment act and as a matter of record the entire Lok Sabha voted unanimously and there was no abstention in Lok Sabha and that amendment act was passed. In Rajya Sabha, there was no opposition. We the people their ordainment came to be reflected through the most sanctified mechanisms through the applicable mechanisms. That power was undone. The world does not know of any such instance. I appeal to all judicial minds please think of a parallel in the world where a constitutional provision can be undone,” the vice president stated.

In the presence of then Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud, several Supreme Court judges, Union Ministers, then Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and several lawyers, Dhankhar further said, “Power resides in ‘We the People’ – their mandate, their wisdom… If a constitutional provision that carries the ordainment of the people at large in such a vibrant democracy is undone, what will happen? I appeal to the people here, they constitute a judicial elite class, thinking minds, intellectuals – please find out a parallel in the world where a constitutional provision can be undone.”

He also asserted that while the Indian Constitution clearly states in Article 145(3) that the court may interpret the Constitution where a serious question of law is involved. “Nowhere it say a provision can be run down.”

When VP Jagdeep Dhankhar came down heavily on the Supreme Court for scrapping the NJAC

Back in December 2022, Dhankhar criticised the Supreme Court over the 99th Constitutional Amendment Bill paving way for the National Judicial Appointment Commission (NJAC), which was undone by the Supreme Court in 2015.

“The Parliament in a much-needed historic step passed the 99th Constitutional Amendment Bill, paving the way for the National Judicial Appointment Commission (NJAC). There was unprecedented support for the above. On August 13, 2014, the Lok Sabha unanimously voted in its favour with there being no abstentions. This House too, passed it unanimously on August 14, 2014, with one abstention. Rarely in Parliamentary democracy, there has been such massive support to a Constitutional legislation,” Dhankhar said.

“This process fructified into a Constitutional prescription, after 16 State Assemblies out of 29 States ratified the Central Legislation; the President of India, in terms of Article 111, accorded his consent on December 31, 2014,” he added.

Furthermore, then Vice President, Jagdeep Dhankhar stated that this was the first time that a duly legitimised constitutional prescription was judicially undone, “This historic parliamentary mandate was undone by the Supreme Court on October 16, 2015 by a majority of 4:1 finding the same as not being in consonance with the judicially evolved doctrine of ‘Basic Structure’ of the Constitution,” said.

Dhankhar had called the scrapping of the NJAC a severe compromise of parliamentary sovereignty and disregard of the mandate of the people, of which this house and the Lok Sabha are custodians.

VP Dhankhar had also emphasised that Parliament is the exclusive and ultimate determinative of the architecture of the Constitution.

“We need to bear in mind that in democratic governance, the basis of any ‘Basic Structure’ is the prevalence of primacy of the mandate of the people reflected in the Parliament. Parliament is the exclusive and ultimate determinative of the architecture of the Constitution,” said.

It must be recalled that back in 2014, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government brought the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) Act in an attempt to change the system of appointment of judges. The NJAC was a proposed body, which would have been responsible for the appointment and transfer of judges to the higher judiciary. The NJAC Act and the Constitutional Amendment Act came into force on April 13, 2015. But the top court on October 16, 2015, struck down the NJAC Act. The verdict brought back the primacy of the collegium system of judges appointing judges.

VP Jagdeep Dhankhar differed from Supreme Court’s idea of ‘basic structure’ doctrine

In January 2023, Dhankhar once again reignited the discussion over the doctrine of the separation of powers. This time, he cited the Supreme Court’s landmark judgment in the 1973 Kesavanand Bharati case wherein the court had ruled that while Parliament had the authority to amend the Constitution, it cannot amend its basic structure.

Delivering his inaugural address at the 83rd All-India Presiding Officers Conference in Jaipur, Jagdeep Dhankhar questioned: “Are we a democratic nation?”

Asserting that all three pillars of democracy: legislature, executive and judiciary must function within their limits, then Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar said, “In a democratic society, the basis of any basic structure is supremacy of the people, sovereignty of the people, sovereignty of Parliament. Executive thrives on the sovereignty of Parliament. Legislatures and Parliament decide who will be the Chief Minister, who will be the Prime Minister. The ultimate power is with the Legislature. The Legislature decides who will be in other institutions. In such a situation, all Constitutional institutions – the Legislative, Executive, Judiciary – are required to be within their limits.”

Expressing his disagreement over the Supreme Court ruling in the Kesavanand Bharati case that the Parliament cannot amend the constitution’s basic structure, Dhankhar said, “In 1973, in the Kesavananda Bharati case, the Supreme Court gave the idea of basic structure, saying that Parliament can amend the Constitution, but not its basic structure. With due respect to the Judiciary, I cannot subscribe to this.”

‘Time has come to revisit’: When Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar questioned the involvement of the CJI in executive appointments

In February 2025, Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar questioned how the judiciary can be involved in executive appointments as the Supreme Court of India was hearing a petition seeking to include the Chief Justice of India in the selection committee for the Election Commission. He said while earlier the executive yielded to the inclusion of judges in executive functions, it was time to revisit the norms.

Speaking at the National Judicial Academy, Bhopal, Dhankhar said that such a system should not exist in a democracy like India. He wondered how the Chief Justice of India participates in the selection of the CBI director, even by “statutory prescription”.

The vice president said, “To stir your minds, how can in a country like ours or in any democracy, by statutory prescription, the Chief Justice of India participate in the selection of the CBI director! Can there be any legal rationale for it? I can appreciate that the statutory prescription took shape because the Executive of the day has yielded to a judicial verdict. But time has come to revisit.”

Jagdeep Dhankhar further said, “This surely does not merge with democracy. How can we involve the Chief Justice of India in any executive appointment?”

Dhankhar went on to say that while the Supreme Court has the power to interpret the constitution, there can be no “arrogation of authority” under the guise of interpretation. The essence and spirit which the founding fathers had in mind under Article 145(3) must be respected.”

He further advocated for an increase in the constitutional bench strength, as originally the constitution bench comprised the majority of total judges.

“When the strength of the Supreme Court was eight judges, under Article 145(3), there was a stipulation that interpretation of the Constitution would be by a bench of five judges or more. Please note, when this strength was eight, it was five. And the Constitution allows the highest court of the land to interpret the Constitution. If I analyse arithmetically, they were very sure the interpretation will be by the majority of judges, because the strength then was eight. That five stands as it is. And the number (of total judges) is more than fourfold,” he said.

VP Dhankhar’s advocacy for including domain experts in arbitral process instead of retired judges

In March 2025, Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar said that the arbitral process in India is “just an additional burden to the normal hierarchical mechanism of adjudication.”

Addressing the Colloquium organised by the India International Arbitration Centre (IIAC) at Bharat Mandapam, Dhankhar said, “Arbitrators play as much critical role as members of the bar associated with the arbiter process. Surprisingly, there is, I’m saying it with utmost restraint, absolute tight-fist control of a segment of a category that is involved with arbiter process determination. This tight-fist control emanates out of judicial feats. And if we examine it on an objective platform, it is excruciatingly painful.”

Emphasising the significance of Article 136 and its effects on the arbitration process, Dhankhar said that while Article 136 was supposed to be a narrow slit, it is hurting the arbitral process.

“The Attorney General of the country can really reflect and make a big change. Which country in the world, Attorney, tell me, has suo moto cognisance by the highest court? I’m sure I can’t look around. And Article 136 intervention was supposed to be a narrow-slit. The wall has been demolished with anything and everything under the sun, including what a magistrate has to do, what a Session Judge has to do, what a District Judge has to do, and what a High Court Judge has to do. That wall demolition is also hurting the arbitral process. All I am suggesting, in all humility and as a concerned citizen of this country, is that the issue you are debating is critical to micro and small industries. They want a facile, easy arbitral process”.

Jagdeep Dhankhar condemned Supreme Court’s “judicial overreach”, calling it an unelected ‘super Parliament’

In April 2025, VP Jagdeep Dhankhar harshly criticised the recent Supreme Court verdict regarding the powers of the Governor and the President under Articles 200 and 201 of the Constitution. In the Judgment passed on 8th April 2025, a division bench of the Supreme Court set a time limit, not envisaged in the Constitution, on the exercise of power to grant or refuse assent to a state Bill by the President and the Governor. The Supreme Court prescribed a deadline of 3 months on the President’s power to grant or refuse assent to a Bill reserved by the Governor for his consideration.

Without mincing words, VP Dhankhar questioned the Supreme Court for issuing a direction to the President of India. He reminded the Supreme Court that its power is limited to interpreting the Constitution. “We cannot have a situation where you direct the President of India, and on what basis? The only right you have under the Constitution is to interpret the Constitution under Article 145(3), ” said the Vice President in an address during the Valedictory Function of the 6th Rajya Sabha Internship Program at Vice-President’s Enclave on 17th April.

“The President is called upon to decide in a time-bound manner, and if not, it becomes law. So we have judges who will legislate, who will perform executive functions, who will act as super-parliament, and absolutely have no accountability because the law of the land does not apply to them,” he said.

Highlighting the fact that the judgment, which had the effect of modifying the concerned provisions, was delivered by a bench of two judges which did not represent the majority of the total number of judges in the Supreme Court.

“When Article 145(3) was there, the number of judges in the Supreme Court was eight, 5 out of 8, now 5 out of 30 and odd. But forget about it, the judges who issued a mandamus virtually to the President and presented a scenario that it will be the law of the land, have forgotten the power of the Constitution. How can that combination of judges deal with something under Article 145(3) if preserved, it was then for five out of eight. We need to make amends for that also now. Five out of eight would mean interpretation will be by majority. Well, five constitutes more than the majority in eight. But leave that aside. Article 142 has become a nuclear missile against Democratic forces, available to the judiciary 24 x 7,” Dhankhar said.

Notably, in the verdict passed in The State of Tamil Nadu v The Governor of Tamil Nadu and Anr, the Apex Court examined the ambit of powers of the President and the Governor conferred under Articles 200 and 201 of the Constitution. The Supreme Court held that the President should decide on the Bills sent to him by the Governor for consideration within 3 months, and that any delay beyond the prescribed time limit should be justified by recording reasons. Besides, the Court ruled that if the President fails to decide on a Bill within 3 months, then the State government can seek the issuance of the writ of mandamus from the Supreme Court against the President. The judgment has been widely criticised for alleged judicial overreach or a judicial attempt to effectively amend the constitution.

Dhankhar questioned the handling of the Justice Yashwant Varma case

Former Vice-President Dhankhar had also raised questions on how the Supreme Court handled the matter relating to the discovery of huge amounts of unaccounted cash at the house of Justice Yashwant Varma. “An event happened on the night of the 14th and 15th of March in New Delhi, at the residence of a judge. For seven days, no one knew about it. We have to ask questions to ourselves. Is the delay explainable? Condonable? Does it not raise certain fundamental questions? In any ordinary situation, and ordinary situations define the rule of law, things would have been different. It was only on 21st March, disclosed by a newspaper, that people of the country were shocked as never before, ” the Vice-President remarked.

“I support judicial independence — but ACCOUNTABILITY IS KEY.” pic.twitter.com/THpUDUe6aO — Megh Updates 🚨™ (@MeghUpdates) July 7, 2025

“Thereafter, fortunately, in the public domain, we had input from an authoritative source, the Supreme Court of India. And the input indicated culpability. Input did not lead to doubt that something was amiss. Something requires to be investigated. Now the nation waits with bated breath. The nation is restive because one of our institutions, to which people have always looked up with the highest respect and deference, was put in the dock,” he added.

Jagdeep Dhankhar: The man who questioned judicial overreach, sought accountability and advocated for balance of powers even in the face of backlash from the opposition and slandering by the leftist ecosystem

Dhankhar’s fierce critiques of what he deemed judicial overreach and encroachment of the powers of the legislature were not without pushback. Beyond the insulting mimicries, several opposition leaders labelled Dhankhar as ‘non-neutral’ and his comments slamming the judiciary ‘unconstitutional’. The opposition parties and the leftist media cabal even accused the former VP of ‘undermining’ judicial independence. Not to forget, the leftist propaganda portal The Wire went as far as to call Dhankhar a “partisan attack dog” over VP Dhankhar’s criticism of the Supreme Court for using Article 142 and calling it a “nuclear missile against democratic forces”.

Despite the slandering, mockery and criticism, Dhankhar did not shy away from raising concern over judicial overreach, particularly in matters involving a delicate balance of power among the judiciary, executive and legislature. Even in the judge Yaswant Varma case, Jagdeep Dhankhar publicly questioned the actions of the Supreme Court, raising concerns regarding accountability in a democracy wherein elected representatives are subject to scrutiny but judges are nearly immune to all sorts of accountability and scrutiny.

While the opposition and the leftist media ecosystem accused VP Dhankhar of delivering politically charged rhetoric at the behest of his ‘political masters’, the BJP, VP Dhankhar’s remarks were not politically charged or at odds with his constitutional duty, rather, his criticism of the judiciary was driven by a genuine concern over a pattern wherein the judiciary seems to be discharging the duties of President, and at times those of the Parliament as well.

Dhankhar’s courage, however, has not been surprising as even during his tenure as the governor of West Bengal, he repeatedly raised concern over post-poll violence in the state and severely criticised the TMC government for the Birbhum massacre. He remained at loggerheads with the CM Mamata Banerjee-led state government over issues pertaining to federalism and governance, condemning the near-collapse of democracy in the state.

While the opposition and its media cheerleaders mocked Jagdeep Dhankhar, belittled the importance of the Vice President’s post and projected the judiciary as somewhat sacrosanct to criticism, even moved a failed impeachment motion, Jagdeep Dhankhar stood his ground, not for personal gains, not for clout, not for political leverage, but for democracy, for constitution and the supremacy of the people’s mandate.

Several parliamentarians had earlier also raised concerns over judicial activism and overreach; however, Dhankhar’s interventions brought the debate to the forefront, triggering the judiciary, lawmakers and the public to ponder over the question of the judiciary’s role in a healthy democracy.

Jagdeep Dhankhar’s tenure as the Vice President of India and Rajya Sabha chairman will be remembered for many good reasons, especially his role as a defender of constitutional balance. He gave a fervent call for judicial accountability, critiqued judicial overreach while reiterating his belief in parliamentary supremacy. While the opposition parties gave him nothing but insults, mockery and hate, Dhankhar tried to accommodate opposition voices despite ideological differences. Dhankhar’s resignation marks the end of a chapter; however, the questions he raised about the judiciary’s role and accountability will continue to shape India’s constitutional discourse.",21st july

OpIndia,14/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/first-balasore-self-immolation-now-greater-noida-suicide-the-problem-of-harassment-of-students/,"First Balasore self-immolation, now Greater Noida suicide: Why do we need such tragedies to wake us up to the problem of harassment of students","Jyoti Sharma, a second-year student from Sharda University in Greater Noida, pursuing BDS, died by suicide in her hostel room. She passed away on July 18, Friday, reportedly after writing a suicide note. The note accuses two professors and the university administration of mental harassment. The two staff members, Mahinder and Shairy, have been arrested so far.

In the suicide letter, she wrote that she had been mentally harassed and humiliated for a long time, which caused her significant distress. She expressed her desire for the accused to face legal action. She held the teachers of PCP and Dental Materials responsible for her death.

The note reads, “They mentally harassed me. They humiliated me. I have been under stress because of them for a long time. I want them to face the same thing. I am sorry. I can’t live like this anymore. I can’t…”

Shortly after the incident came to light, students gathered and protested against the university administration, alleging negligence. They claimed Jyoti had been under immense stress due to accusations of forging signatures. A minor scuffle broke out between the protesters and the police, while the family of the deceased was seen manhandling the head of the dentistry department.

The incident occurred on Friday night, and a case has been filed at the Knowledge Park Police Station in Gautam Buddha Nagar. “The woman’s body has been sent for post-mortem, and two staff members of the university have been arrested on the basis of a complaint filed by the victim’s family,” said Additional DCP of Greater Noida, Sudhir Kumar.

He added that tension had escalated due to the anger among the deceased’s family and university students towards the administration. The anger and scuffle were defused by the police through dialogue, and peace was restored at the scene. Further legal proceedings are underway.

Dr. Ajit Kumar, the university’s Public Relations Officer, confirmed that two faculty members have been suspended. “For now, two teachers have been suspended. A committee has also been formed to investigate the matter. Action will be taken against those found guilty based on the committee’s report,” he stated.

This is not an isolated case of a student taking her life due to harassment. A similar incident took place in Odisha’s Balasore shocking self-immolation case on July 12. A 20-year-old girl set herself on fire, allegedly after enduring sexual harassment by the head of her college department. She suffered 90 percent burns and later succumbed to her injuries at AIIMS Bhubaneswar on July 14.

These brutal incidents show no discrimination based on gender or age. This was evident in the tragic case of a teenager from The Global Public School in Kerala who ended his life after reportedly being bullied, assaulted, and harassed by his schoolmates.

According to the teenager’s mother, on January 15, he was forcibly taken to the toilet and made to lick the seat; his head was then pushed into the toilet while it was flushed. He was also bullied for his skin tone. The relentless harassment severely affected his mental health, ultimately driving him to end his life by jumping from the 26th floor of their apartment building.

On April 30, 2023, a 16-year-old boy died by suicide after allegedly being mentally abused by his principal and faculty members. He purportedly left a suicide note in which he apologized to his parents and elder brothers and urged serious action against those who had harassed him. The boy allegedly died by suicide in Telangana, with his family accusing the college management and certain members of the teaching staff of harassment and holding them responsible for his death, police reported. The student, in his first year of intermediate studies at a private college in Narsingi, Telangana, was found hanging in a classroom by his friends on Tuesday night, April 30.

All these incidents reflect one painful similarity: before taking their own lives, the victims tried to express what they were going through and, in the end, wrote in their suicide notes. Instead of receiving empathy and support from those around them when they spoke up about harassment in educational institutions, their voices were often ignored. Their stories must be heard, and their grievances must be addressed before blaming the victim. Continued ignorance will only lead to more such tragedies unless educational institutions actively work towards providing safe, empathetic, and responsive environments for students.",jyoti sharma second year student sharda university greater noida pursuing bd died suicide hostel room passed away july 18 friday reportedly writing suicide note note accuses two professor university administration mental harassment two staff member mahinder shairy arrested far suicide letter wrote mentally harassed humiliated long time caused significant distress expressed desire accused face legal action held teacher pcp dental material responsible death note read “they mentally harassed humiliated stress long time want face thing sorry can’t live like anymore can’t…” shortly incident came light student gathered protested university administration alleging negligence claimed jyoti immense stress due accusation forging signature minor scuffle broke protester police family deceased seen manhandling head dentistry department incident occurred friday night case filed knowledge park police station gautam buddha nagar “the woman’s body sent post mortem two staff member university arrested basis complaint filed victim’s family ” said additional dcp greater noida sudhir kumar added tension escalated due anger among deceased’s family university student towards administration anger scuffle defused police dialogue peace restored scene legal proceeding underway dr ajit kumar university’s public relation officer confirmed two faculty member suspended “for two teacher suspended committee also formed investigate matter action taken found guilty based committee’s report ” stated isolated case student taking life due harassment similar incident took place odisha’s balasore shocking self immolation case july 12 20 year old girl set fire allegedly enduring sexual harassment head college department suffered 90 percent burn later succumbed injury aiims bhubaneswar july 14 brutal incident show discrimination based gender age evident tragic case teenager global public school kerala ended life reportedly bullied assaulted harassed schoolmate according teenager’s mother january 15 forcibly taken toilet made lick seat head pushed toilet flushed also bullied skin tone relentless harassment severely affected mental health ultimately driving end life jumping 26th floor apartment building april 30 2023 16 year old boy died suicide allegedly mentally abused principal faculty member purportedly left suicide note apologized parent elder brother urged serious action harassed boy allegedly died suicide telangana family accusing college management certain member teaching staff harassment holding responsible death police reported student first year intermediate study private college narsingi telangana found hanging classroom friend tuesday night april 30 incident reflect one painful similarity taking life victim tried express going end wrote suicide note instead receiving empathy support around spoke harassment educational institution voice often ignored story must heard grievance must addressed blaming victim continued ignorance lead tragedy unless educational institution actively work towards providing safe empathetic responsive environment student
OpIndia,14/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/truck-still-stuck-collapsed-gambhira-bridge-gujarat-as-media-blames-officials-know-what-happened/,"Truck still stuck on collapsed Gambhira bridge in Gujarat: As media blames officials, Anand district collector shares the real reason with OpIndia","After a part of the Gambhira Bridge connecting Saurashtra region and Central Gujarat collapsed on the morning of 9th July, 2025, a truck which got stuck on the bridge is still hanging there, fifteen days after the incident.

Some media reports based on the interviews of the truck driver and the owner claimed that the officials of the two districts of Anand and Vadodara are denying their accountability, which is causing unnecessary hardships to the truck driver and the owner, who have been running from pillar to post to get the truck removed. Pending EMIs are adding to the worries of the truck driver, who is not even able to claim the insurance.

A report in Divya Bhaskar quoted truck owner Ramashankar Pal as saying, ” The officials of the Anand government office are putting the responsibility on Vadodara, and the officials of Vadodara are putting the responsibility on Anand. We are tired of facing all the hassles. The officials replied that the army was also requested to remove the truck by helicopter, but there is no possibility of the truck being removed right now.”

The truck owner further told Bhaskar, “I have a loan on the truck and I have to pay an instalment of Rs 1 lakh every month. If the truck runs, I will be able to pay the instalment. The administration had given me an assurance for removing the truck, but even after so many days, I have not been able to get the truck.”

The title of the Divya Bhaskar report reads- ‘First the truck was hanging, now the officials are ‘hanging’ it: Even after 10 days of the accident, the truck is still on the Gambhira bridge, the driver is wandering to unload the truck, saying – there is an instalment of lakhs per month.’

A Gujarati News’ TV channel, GSTV wrote, ‘The government has raised its hands’, the situation of the truck owner is difficult, and no one is listening to him. It has also been claimed in this report that the truck owner has been doing the rounds of the government offices of Anand-Vadodara for ten days, but he did not get any response. “We have to pay the instalments for the truck. The bank is saying that we have to pay the instalments, while the insurance company is saying that the truck is safe, no insurance will be given,” said the truck owner as quoted by GSTV.

Anand District Collector spoke to OpIndia

When OpIndia contacted Anand District Collector Praveen Chaudhary regarding the entire matter, a different version came to light. He said that there is no dispute between the two districts, and neither is the delay due to the administration blaming each other. The reality is that the truck could not be removed due to some technical reasons that emerged during the rescue operation that lasted for several days. However, the Anand District Collectorate is providing all possible help to the truck owner.

Divulging the details about the entire incident, the Anand District Collector said, “After the bridge accident, it was impossible to take heavy machinery like cranes on the bridge due to technical reasons. The truck will need to be lifted from the front, which was damaged, using a crane. But the Road and Building Department believed that using a crane in such a situation is dangerous.” He said that the rescue operation has been going on continuously, and machines were deployed till yesterday. Now that the rescue operation is almost complete, a team from the mechanical wing of the Road and Building Construction Department is working on it in collaboration with a private company and experts from High Speed Railway Corporation Limited.

“Whether the truck should be pulled back or lifted by providing some support from below is being contemplated. It also has to be seen that there is no danger to any human life in this,” the District Collector said.

The truck was not removed, as a rescue operation was going on

The reason for the delay in removing the truck is that the rescue operation went on for several days after the accident. A tanker was not found, so a sonar machine was brought from Mumbai to search and locate it underwater. When the NDRF started the rescue operation after the incident, the district administration was requested to keep the stranded truck tied so that it would not pose any danger to the rescue efforts going on under the bridge, as the rescue operation was a priority at that time.

After discussing with the NDRF team, the district administration tied the truck to a crane from the back to ensure that the rescue operation went on unaffected. When the Army was consulted, it said that pushing or pulling the truck would require the involvement of people and would put their lives in danger. At present, technical teams of the Road and Building Department are working on the strategy to remove the truck ,and it will be disposed of soon. Teams from both the district administrations are also assisting in the operation.

The collector also clarified the issue of insurance and EMI

The Anand District Collector said that the truck owner visited his office and met him and the additional district magistrate, who explained everything to him. The owner agreed for the truck to be destroyed, but it has to be done in such a way that does not put any life in danger. The plan to do this is being worked out.

As far as insurance is concerned, the District Collector said that he met the insurance company. The company said that if the government gave a written certificate of the incident, they would approve the insurance claim. The collector’s office has also given assurance in this regard, and the written process will be completed with the company.

Regarding EMI, the collector said that although this is a matter between the bank and the truck owner, the administration cannot directly interfere in it, yet he wrote a letter to the bank and requested it to postpone the instalment for two to three months on humanitarian grounds. Also, a representation will be sent to the State Level Bankers Committee, so that the truck owner can get relief on EMI.

The District Collector made it clear that this is not an Anand-Vadodara issue. The area where this incident happened and the truck got stuck is entirely in Vadodara, but since the Vadodara administration was continuously engaged in the rescue operation, the Anand district administration stepped in and provided all possible assistance.",part gambhira bridge connecting saurashtra region central gujarat collapsed morning 9th july 2025 truck got stuck bridge still hanging fifteen day incident medium report based interview truck driver owner claimed official two district anand vadodara denying accountability causing unnecessary hardship truck driver owner running pillar post get truck removed pending emis adding worry truck driver even able claim insurance truck hanging broken gambhira bridge image via x theskindoctor13 report divya bhaskar quoted truck owner ramashankar pal saying ” official anand government office putting responsibility vadodara official vadodara putting responsibility anand tired facing hassle official replied army also requested remove truck helicopter possibility truck removed right ” truck owner told bhaskar “i loan truck pay instalment r 1 lakh every month truck run able pay instalment administration given assurance removing truck even many day able get truck ” title divya bhaskar report read ‘first truck hanging official ‘hanging’ even 10 day accident truck still gambhira bridge driver wandering unload truck saying – instalment lakh per month ’ gujarati news’ tv channel gstv wrote ‘the government raised hands’ situation truck owner difficult one listening also claimed report truck owner round government office anand vadodara ten day get response “we pay instalment truck bank saying pay instalment insurance company saying truck safe insurance given ” said truck owner quoted gstv anand district collector spoke opindia opindia contacted anand district collector praveen chaudhary regarding entire matter different version came light said dispute two district neither delay due administration blaming reality truck could removed due technical reason emerged rescue operation lasted several day however anand district collectorate providing possible help truck owner divulging detail entire incident anand district collector said “after bridge accident impossible take heavy machinery like crane bridge due technical reason truck need lifted front damaged using crane road building department believed using crane situation dangerous ” said rescue operation going continuously machine deployed till yesterday rescue operation almost complete team mechanical wing road building construction department working collaboration private company expert high speed railway corporation limited “whether truck pulled back lifted providing support contemplated also seen danger human life ” district collector said truck removed rescue operation going reason delay removing truck rescue operation went several day accident tanker found sonar machine brought mumbai search locate underwater ndrf started rescue operation incident district administration requested keep stranded truck tied would pose danger rescue effort going bridge rescue operation priority time discussing ndrf team district administration tied truck crane back ensure rescue operation went unaffected army consulted said pushing pulling truck would require involvement people would put life danger present technical team road building department working strategy remove truck disposed soon team district administration also assisting operation collector also clarified issue insurance emi anand district collector said truck owner visited office met additional district magistrate explained everything owner agreed truck destroyed done way put life danger plan worked far insurance concerned district collector said met insurance company company said government gave written certificate incident would approve insurance claim collector’s office also given assurance regard written process completed company regarding emi collector said although matter bank truck owner administration cannot directly interfere yet wrote letter bank requested postpone instalment two three month humanitarian ground also representation sent state level banker committee truck owner get relief emi district collector made clear anand vadodara issue area incident happened truck got stuck entirely vadodara since vadodara administration continuously engaged rescue operation anand district administration stepped provided possible assistance
OpIndia,14/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/pib-fake-news-samosa-jalebi-health-warning-cigarettes-media-news/,Fake claim: PIB calls out false media reports that union health ministry is set to issue health warning for samosa and jalebi like they...,"Many Indian media outlets, including Times of India and NDTV, recently published a news story alleging that popular Indian snacks and sweets such as samosa, jalebi and laddoo will be served alongside a health warning akin to those on cigarette packets. Furthermore, the new development was attributed to the Union Ministry of Health that it has been done in order to tackle health issues.

On 15th July, PIB fact-check, however, refuted the claims as false. It emphasized that the ministry’s advisory does not include any warning labels on food items sold by vendors and “has not been selective towards Indian snacks.”

Additionally, it clarified that the general recommendation is not unique to any one food product but rather serves as a “behavioural nudge” to alert consumers to “hidden fats and excess sugar in all food products.”

✅The general advisory is a behavioural nudge to make people aware of hidden fats and excess sugar in all food products, and not specifically to any particular food product.



The advisory is for healthier options and initiatives at workplaces and urges people to make healthier… pic.twitter.com/gD3f2XOeTF — PIB Fact Check (@PIBFactCheck) July 15, 2025

The agency added that the suggestion encourages “people to make healthier” decisions to reduce unnecessary sugar and oil in favour of a healthy diet and way of life as well as supports healthier workplace options and activities. “It does not target India’s rich street food culture,” it further pointed out.

What is in the letter

The ministry’s official letter identified “sharp rise in obesity in both children and adults” as a significant concern. It informed, “As per NFHS-5 (2019-21), over one in five adults in urban areas are overweight or obese. Prevalence of childhood obesity is impacted by poor dietary habits and reduced physical activity.”

It added, “As per The Lancet GBD 2021 obesity forecasting study, published in 2025, the number of overweight and obese adults in India is projected to rise from 18 crores in 2021 to 44.9 crores by 2050, making it the country with the second-highest global burden.” It stated that obesity dramatically increases the risk of non-communicable diseases like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease and several types of cancer.

The ministry pointed out, “It also affects mental health, mobility, and quality of life, and imposes a heavy economic burden through increased healthcare costs and productivity losses. Early prevention and health promotion are critical to reversing these trends.”

The letter outlined that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made a strong case for changing people’s lifestyles in order to fight obesity. “At the Opening Ceremony of the 38th National Games in Dehradun on 28th January 2025, Hon’ble Prime Minister invoked the Fit India Campaign and urged citizens to adopt active, healthy lifestyles as part of the broader vision of a Swasth Bharat. In his Mann Ki Baat, he called for a 10% reduction in oil consumption,” the official communiqué read.

It then conveyed, “In response to this national appeal, and as part of the ministry’s flagship initiatives under the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases (NP-NCD), it is imperative to promote sustainable behavioural changes in our workplaces. These include reducing excessive consumption of oil and sugar, both of which are key contributors to rising rates of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and other lifestyle-related disorders.”

According to the letter, it is advocating that Sugar and Oil Boards be displayed as an effort to encourage better eating practices in multiple settings.

Claims linking sudden deaths to COVID vaccine

Several claims linking sudden deaths caused by heart attack to the COVID-19 vaccine have been spreading across social media for years. However, the central government debunked all these claims earlier this month, on the grounds of two extensive studies conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research(ICMR) and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences. The studies found that there was no direct link between sudden deaths by heart attack and the COVID-19 vaccines.

Besides, studies by the ICMR and National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) affirmed that COVID-19 vaccines in India are safe and effective, with extremely rare instances of serious side effects. Sudden deaths due to heart attacks can be linked to a wide range of factors, including genetics, lifestyle, pre-existing conditions, and post-COVID complications.

To understand the causes of sudden, unexplained deaths, especially in young adults between the ages of 18 and 45 years, the ICMR and the NCDC conducted a study across 47 tertiary care hospitals in 19 states and UTs. Another study conducted by AIIMS with ICMR funding also examined cases of sudden cardiac deaths and found genetic mutations, pre-existing conditions, and lifestyle as the primary causes of these deaths and no correlation with Covid-19 vaccination.",medium portal print recently seen spreading fake news purported study conducted central government analyse pattern “to assess pattern sudden deaths” india covid 19 pandemic print published news article july 8 2025 claimed health research department dhr union ministry health collaborating inclen international clinical epidemiology network international new delhi based health research organisation conduct national community level study examine rise death among people 45 year age screenshot news article published print quoting inclen international executive director proposed lead analyst n k arora print claimed “the new nationwide assessment aim document sudden death community level across states” added “this larger study analyse trend death attempt determine risk factor mortalities” however print news article fact checked pib termed claim made fake news report theprintindia claimed centre commissioned nationwide study assess pattern sudden death india pibfactcheck ❌ claim fake ✅ nationwide survey commissioned centre department health… pic twitter com gpsrc1hz1c — pib fact check pibfactcheck july 9 2025 pib posted x “in news report theprintindia claimed centre commissioned nationwide study assess pattern sudden death india nationwide survey commissioned centre depthealthres dhr ” claim linking sudden death covid vaccine several claim linking sudden death caused heart attack covid 19 vaccine spreading across social medium year however central government debunked claim earlier month ground two extensive study conducted indian council medical research icmr india institute medical science study found direct link sudden death heart attack covid 19 vaccine besides study icmr national centre disease control ncdc affirmed covid 19 vaccine india safe effective extremely rare instance serious side effect sudden death due heart attack linked wide range factor including genetics lifestyle pre existing condition post covid complication understand cause sudden unexplained death especially young adult age 18 45 year icmr ncdc conducted study across 47 tertiary care hospital 19 state ut another study conducted aiims icmr funding also examined case sudden cardiac death found genetic mutation pre existing condition lifestyle primary cause death correlation covid 19 vaccination

The book titled “Exploring Society: India and Beyond” introduces students to some important events and episodes in Indian history, including the Delhi Sultanate, the Mughal rule, the Maratha empire and the colonial period. The book has recently become the cause of a huge liberal meltdown.

The book has a chapter titled “Reshaping India’s Political Map”, which covers Indian history between the 13th and the 17th century, including the rise and fall of the Delhi Sultanate and the resistance to it, the Vijayanagar Empire, the Mughal Empire, and the resistance faced by them, and the rise of the Sikhs.

At the beginning of the book comes is a note for students, which gives them a contextual understanding of the inclusion of some dark historical episodes like the Islamic fundamentalism in the book and the approach to be adopted while studying them. “History sometimes seems to be full of wars and destruction… Should we omit them entirely? … The best approach is to face them and analyse them so as to understand what made such developments possible and, hopefully, help avoid their recurrence in future. It is important to study those darker developments dispassionately, without blaming anyone living today for them… The past continues to live with us and shapes the present.”

To be introduced in schools from the 2025-26 academic year, the book attempts to provide a complete picture of historical events or periods included in it by retaining their negative as well as positive aspects. While the book mentions how Mughal rulers Jahangir and Shah Jahan patronised art and architecture, it also highlights the brutalities of Babur, who massacred the entire populations of cities. It describes Aurangzeb as a military ruler who banned un-Islamic practices and reimposed taxes on non-Muslims and defines the rule of Mughal ruler Akbar, the left-liberal coterie’s poster boy of the Mughal period, as a “blend of brutality and tolerance”.

But the left liberals, who are habitual of using history as a tool to further their agenda, have a problem with it. They have a problem because the facade built by leftist historians who downplayed and whitewashed the brutalities of Islamic invaders and justified their atrocities against Hindus is crumbling. For a long time, they pushed a false narrative by portraying Mughal King Akbar as the epitome of religious tolerance. They eulogised him for abolishing the Jizya tax, a religious tax levied by Muslim rulers on Hindus and other non-Muslims for merely existing in an Islamic regime, but cleverly omitted to mention how he waged Jihad against Hindus during the seige of Chittorgarh and ordered the massacre of 30,000 Hindus populace.

The seige of Chittoragarh

By 1567, Mughal ruler Akbar had managed to get most parts of northern India under his control. Now, he was eyeing the Kingdom of Mewar, which was being ruled by the Suryavanshi Sisodia Rajput dynasty at that time, under Rana Udai Singh II. The Mewar kingdom stood as a symbol of resistance against the Mughal Empire, which had subdued most of the surrounding kingdoms. Akbar decided to launch a military expedition to besiege the Mewar capital at Chittorgarh and termed it as ‘Jihad’ against the infidels (Hindus).

Chittorgarh, situated in present-day Rajasthan, was a formidable fort spanning across 700 acres, situated atop 180 a high hill in the heart of the Mewar Kingdom. The fortress had survived the sieges by Aluddin Khilji (1303) and Bahadur Shah of Gujarat (1535).

Refusing to bow down before the Mughal emperor, Rana Udai Singh II geared up to defend his kingdom. In October 1567, Akbar marched from Agra with his army of 40,000 men equipped with cannons, muskets and siege equipment, aiming to bring the Mewar Kingdom to its knees. Inside the Chittorgarh fort was an army of 8000 Rajput warriors prepared to defend their pride. On the advice of his counsels, Rana Udai Singh II moved to his principality in the Aravali hills and left the Rajput army under the command of Jaimal Rathore.

The Mughal army strategically set up their camp at the base of the Chittorgarh hill to cut off supplies to the fort. The siege began, and both armies soon engaged in a full-fledged battle with arrows, musket shots and cannon shots flying across the sky. The Mughal army was struggling to penetrate the 30-feet-thick walls of the Chittorgarh fort. The Mughal soldiers made several strategies to breach the mighty walls of the Chittorgarh fort. They tried to stealthily march towards the base of the fort through covered trenches and dig burrows under the foundation of the fort and pack gunpowder in them to blow up the fort’s base. However, the Rajput armies were watching them. They dug counter-mines and resisted the Mughal armies, which suffered heavy losses.

The battle went on for months, till the fateful day when the Rajput commander Jaimal Rathore fell. There are varied accounts of the cause of Jaimal Rathore’s death. Some accounts say that he died from a musket shot fired by Akbar on February 22, 1568. Other accounts mention that Rathore was killed by Mughal marksmen. Jaimal Rathore’s death was a turning point in the battle, as the Rajput armies were demoralised and the Mughal armies were able to breach the fort. As soon as the fort was breached by the Mughal armies, the Rajput women inside the fort performed jauhar to protect their honour from the enemy. The remaining Rajput soldiers put up a final resistance before the Mughal armies and laid down their lives, before the fort was finally captured on February 23-24, 1568.

Some Mughal sources say that the Rajput armies of about 8000-10,000 men were entirely killed. Mughal king Akbar, who was frustrated and enraged by the stiff resistance put up by the Rajput armies, proclaimed the siege of Chittorgarh and the victory of Islam over infidels and ordered the massacre of the entire civilian population of around 30,000 people. The men were killed, and several women and children were enslaved.

But, according to left-liberals, Mughal King Akbar was a liberal and tolerant ruler, who abolished the Jizya tax, and not a cruel, intolerant tyrant who ordered the slaughter of thousands of innocent, unarmed Hindu civilians of the Chittorgarh fort, who posed no harm to him. This special ability to see one truth by ignoring the other truth is peculiar to the left-liberals. The only acceptable truth to them is their version of truth, no matter how incomplete, selective or even untrue it is.

This unique quality of theirs begs the question, Jo cheez jaisi hai usey vaisa usey vaisa he pesh kyo na kiya jaye, taat ko resham kyo kaha jaye?

It has been revealed that humans lived in that are around 4,000 years ago. Scientists who were searching for additional information about the captivating location in the Raichur district made the discovery. A collaborative team of 20 researches from India, Canada and the United States worked together to learn more about the area’s past.

Researchers have been excavating around Mallikarjun Hill, close to the Mallikarjuna Temple and the town’s Anjaneya Swamy temple. They have come across a variety of artefacts and other tools that date back four millennia which suggests that the area was once a vibrant settlement.

Professor Dr Andrew M. Bauer of Stanford University in the United States, Dr. Peter G. Johansen of McGill University in Canada and Hemanth Kadambi of Shiv Nadar University in Delhi-NCR (National Capital Region) alongside their team of over 20 researchers have been seeking evidence of human habitation and civilisation in Maski for the past three months.

They approached Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) for approval and afterward the crew began exploring Maski. The scientists identified 271 places of interest in the area and began their work. They unearthed evidence that the area surrounding the temple and Mallikarjun Hill was occupied by people from the 11th to the 14th century BCE.

They located an array of antiquities, including cooking tools like earthen pots and pans. Kadambi declared, “We have found evidence that indicates that there was a human settlement in Maski around 4,000 years ago.”

Maski inscription

Notably, British gold mine engineer C. Beadon found the Maski inscription in 1915. The region made its place on the archaeological map when the inscription, which dates to the time of the Mauryan emperor Ashoka, came to light. It was etched onto a rock surface within a cave.

One of the earliest inscriptions from the Mauryan era, it prominently displays the emperor’s name and his title as “Devanampriya” (Beloved of the Gods). A long-standing disagreement about whether the legendary ruler was actually referred to by the title or not was resolved when the same was mentioned alongside his name. It was written in Brahmi script and in the Prakrit language, highlighting his adherence to non-violence.",remarkable archaeological finding drawn attention karnataka’s maski town revealed human lived around 4 000 year ago scientist searching additional information captivating location raichur district made discovery collaborative team 20 research india canada united state worked together learn area’s past researcher excavating around mallikarjun hill close mallikarjuna temple town’s anjaneya swamy temple come across variety artefact tool date back four millennium suggests area vibrant settlement professor dr andrew bauer stanford university united state dr peter g johansen mcgill university canada hemanth kadambi shiv nadar university delhi ncr national capital region alongside team 20 researcher seeking evidence human habitation civilisation maski past three month approached archaeological survey india asi approval afterward crew began exploring maski scientist identified 271 place interest area began work unearthed evidence area surrounding temple mallikarjun hill occupied people 11th 14th century bce located array antiquity including cooking tool like earthen pot pan kadambi declared “we found evidence indicates human settlement maski around 4 000 year ago ” maski inscription notably british gold mine engineer c beadon found maski inscription 1915 region made place archaeological map inscription date time mauryan emperor ashoka came light etched onto rock surface within cave one earliest inscription mauryan era prominently display emperor’s name title “devanampriya” beloved god long standing disagreement whether legendary ruler actually referred title resolved mentioned alongside name written brahmi script prakrit language highlighting adherence non violence

While the attack itself was disturbing, what sparked further indignation was how Irish mainstream media chose to report the incident.

Instead of unequivocally condemning the brutality, reports used language that cast doubt on the nature of the crime, referring to it as an “alleged assault” despite the visible and horrific injuries sustained by the victim. This minimisation of violence, which bore all the hallmarks of a racially motivated hate crime, was called out in strong terms by the Indian Ambassador to Ireland, Akhilesh Mishra.

Ambassador Akhilesh Mishra exposes media bias over assault against an Indian origin man

Ambassador Mishra’s comments came with images of news reports that chose to cast doubt over the victim’s trauma, a strategy not unfamiliar to those tracking media narratives targeting Hindus globally. In doing so, Mishra highlighted an uncomfortable truth: that certain Western media institutions would rather gaslight Indian victims than confront the racial or ideological motivations behind such hate crimes.

The incident: A false accusation, brutal assault, and media whitewashing

The Indian man, who had arrived in Ireland just three weeks earlier, was assaulted and partially stripped in public in Tallaght on Saturday evening, July 19. According to The Irish Times, a mob confronted the man and falsely accused him of acting inappropriately around children, claims that were later disseminated online as part of a digital witch-hunt.

Irish police (Gardaí) have since confirmed that no evidence exists to support the accusations, yet the man was violently attacked, left bleeding, and taken to Tallaght University Hospital with serious injuries. Gardaí are now investigating the case as a possible hate crime, and there is speculation that the attack was racially motivated.

Local councillor Baby Pereppadan (Fine Gael) visited the victim and said he remains in shock and is not taking visitors. “Small incidents like these are happening frequently in Tallaght,” he warned, urging stronger police deployment in the area.

Sinn Féin TD Seán Crowe condemned the mob action as “vile and utterly unacceptable.” “Anyone who thinks this sort of mindless, racist violence makes their community safer is lying and fooling no one. This is not the first such attack in our area but it has to be the last,” he said.

A pattern of dehumanisation: Global racism targeting Hindus

While people of colour, especially Africans and South-East Asians, have long faced discrimination in the West, the treatment meted out to Indians, and Hindus in particular, reveals a unique and consistent pattern of prejudice. Hindus are not just exoticised or mocked; they are systematically demonised, dehumanised, and often blamed for the crimes of their persecutors.

Nowhere is this more apparent than in the disturbing trends on social media platforms where Hindu identity, symbols, and customs are routinely mocked with impunity.

From derogatory “cow piss” jibes to offensive caricatures of Hindu deities, the Hinduphobia is not just a cultural issue; it is a civilisational struggle where polytheistic traditions and Sanatan values are targeted by both far-left ideologues and right-wing supremacists, particularly in the West.

One need only look at the case of Stew Peters, a self-styled “America First” commentator who in 2024 described Hindus as “dot-headed cockroaches,” falsely alleging that Indians smear cow dung on their faces. Or Laura Loomer, who launched a xenophobic tirade against Indian-American Sriram Krishnan following his appointment to a senior AI policy position at the White House, calling Indians “third-world invaders.”

The vitriol extended far beyond individuals. Hindu deities like Maa Kali and Lord Ganesha were called “supervillains,” “demonic,” and “unfit for a first-world Christian country.” These sentiments are not just isolated outbursts but part of a coordinated campaign to otherise and vilify the Hindu community, especially those living proudly and unapologetically in the diaspora.

And this bigotry is undergirded by latent racism against Indians, particularly Hindus, and it rises to the surface every now and then, in both physical and psychological form —from attacking them literally as witnessed in Dublin to more sophisticated forms of assault — Hindumisic conferences organised in western universities that serve to legitimise such racism and give way to its more dangerous siblings, bigotry and dehumanisation.

The “Dismantling Global Hindutva” Conference: Institutionalised hatred of Hindus

Perhaps the most blatant example of institutionalised Hinduphobia came in the form of the “Dismantling Global Hindutva” conference held in September 2021. Sponsored by over 60 academic departments from 45+ universities, primarily in the United States, the three-day event brought together some of the most vocal and virulent anti-Hindu activists in academia and media.

The speakers list read like a who’s who of Hindumisia, including Audrey Truschke, Anand Patwardhan, Nandini Sundar, and Neha Dixit, individuals known for drawing false equivalences between Hindutva and Nazism. Ironically, the event’s poster depicted an inverted hammer violently uprooting a saffron-clad RSS Swayamsevak, a visual metaphor for the organised dismantling of Hindu civilisational identity.

The hammer, disguised as a pencil, was meant to portray “academic critique,” but its Nazi-esque symbolism mirrored the Röhm Putsch imagery of Nazi propaganda, where ‘eliminating violent elements’ was used to justify political murders. In this case, the target wasn’t a rogue militia. It was a symbolic attack on Hindus who dare to be assertive about their culture and beliefs.

The points of discussion during the conference followed a classic Goebbelsian propaganda template: select a few emotive triggers, repeat them endlessly, and cast your enemies as the threat to civilisation. It’s a strategy that paves the way for dehumanisation and, eventually, justifies violence.

The RSS or other Hindu organisations targeted aren’t paramilitary thugs. They are groups that aid flood victims, rescue women from trafficking, or assist during pandemics, tasks most self-proclaimed ‘liberal saviours’ wouldn’t touch. So why label them “militant”?

Because self-defence, cultural reclamation, and Hindu unity threaten the ideological monopoly of Islamists, Marxists, and global evangelists.

Research reveals a disturbing surge in Hinduphobic slurs and hate speech across social media platforms

A comprehensive 2023 study by the Network Contagion Research Institute (NCRI) lends credence to Mishra’s concerns. The report, ‘Quantitative Methods for Investigating Anti-Hindu Disinformation’, found a sharp rise in derogatory and genocidal content targeting Hindus across platforms like 4Chan, Telegram, Gab, and Twitter. These include memes and slurs such as “pajeet”, a racial epithet used to mock and dehumanise Hindus, alongside visual propaganda depicting Hindu symbols like tilaks and saffron clothing being subjected to ISIS-style beheadings or Nazi-style executions. The analysis also showed that the usage of such coded hate terms surged dramatically around key geopolitical events involving India, indicating coordinated disinformation efforts.

Perhaps most alarmingly, the NCRI discovered that Iranian state-sponsored troll networks were deeply involved in disseminating Hinduphobic content, often under fake Pakistani identities. These accounts strategically amplified hashtags and tropes accusing Hindus of genocide, inflaming caste divisions, and misrepresenting communal incidents like the 2020 Delhi riots. The trolls pretended to be human rights activists while tagging major news outlets like CNN and MSNBC to internationalise their narrative. This manipulation of digital platforms for geopolitical ends shows that Hinduphobia is not merely social bigotry; it is being weaponised as a tool of hybrid warfare.

The incident in Dublin, therefore, is not just a case of individual victimisation, it is a symptom of a transnational campaign to dehumanise Hindus in both physical and ideological realms. The assault, followed by media whitewashing, echoes the same patterns identified in the NCRI report: digital dehumanisation leading to real-world violence. Mishra’s remarks, then, are not only a defence of one man’s dignity but a broader call to recognise and confront the systemic erasure of Hindu identity under the guise of liberal tolerance.

From Anti-CAA protests to Digital pogroms

The dehumanisation of Hindus gained major momentum during the anti-CAA protests in India. Posters morphed the sacred Om into Nazi swastikas, women wearing bindis were portrayed as oppressors, and slogans like “Hinduon se Azadi” (Freedom from Hindus) echoed across protest sites. The song “Jab sab but tod diye jaayenge, bas Allah ka naam rahega” (“When all idols are broken, only Allah’s name shall remain”) was not fringe. It was mainstream. And it was celebrated.

This same contempt now fuels the global narrative, where being a proud Hindu in the West is considered an act of aggression, and where Indian immigrants are seen not as contributors, but cultural contaminants.

Are Hindus “invading” the West?

Contrary to the far-right and leftist narrative, Hindus aren’t flooding Western countries. As per Pew Research (2024):

Hindus make up only 5% of the global migrant population. Though 94% of Hindus live in India, only 57% of global Hindu migrants are from India. In contrast, Christians form 47% and Muslims 29% of global migrants.

The “Hindu invasion” is a myth, an imaginary construct, a bogeyman to manufacture hate.

From Dublin to Dismantling Hindutva: A global war on Hindus?

The Dublin assault and its casual dismissal by mainstream media is more than just a reporting failure. It is a symptom of a larger disease — a civilisational bias against Hindus that spans continents, cultures, and ideologies.

From hate crimes on the streets of Ireland and America to academic witch hunts like Dismantling Global Hindutva, Hindus today are not just being targeted physically, but also intellectually, politically, and spiritually.

Ambassador Akhilesh Mishra’s tweet is not just a diplomatic protest; it is a call to wake up. To recognise that being Hindu, wearing saffron, reciting shlokas, or simply existing unapologetically, is enough to be branded a target.

The question is no longer whether Hindus are being demonised. The question is: How long will we pretend that it’s not happening?

How online hatred fuels real-world attacks on Indians and Hindus

The Tallaght assault is a chilling reminder that online hate doesn’t just remain on the internet, it metastasizes into real-world violence.

In this case, false accusations against the Indian victim were first circulated online, accusing him of inappropriate behaviour near children. These baseless claims spread like wildfire on local WhatsApp groups and Facebook pages, ultimately emboldening a mob to hunt him down, strip him, beat him, and leave him bleeding on the street.

This incident mirrors a disturbing trend: social media platforms have become hotbeds for anti-Indian and anti-Hindu bigotry, often driven by coordinated misinformation campaigns and algorithmic

The Druze-majority province of Sweida, long considered a relatively stable enclave in a strife-torn country, has plumbed into chaos after violent clashes erupted between Druze self-defence militias and armed Sunni Bedouin tribes.

The Syrian government’s decision to intervene, ostensibly to restore order, has instead drawn fierce criticism, with eyewitnesses and human rights observers accusing Damascus of using the unrest as a pretext to carry out a brutal crackdown on the Druze community.

As the conflict spirals, disturbing reports have emerged of field executions, looting, and arson carried out by state forces and their allies. The violence has laid bare the fragile nature of Syria’s post-Assad political transition, with interim president Ahmed al-Sharaa, himself a former jihadist commander, struggling to maintain legitimacy among minority groups.

What was once framed as a peacekeeping operation is now seen by many Druze as a calculated campaign of ethnic and sectarian cleansing, pushing the region toward open rebellion and international intervention.

Syrian officials have faced allegations of conducting summary executions of civilians in the Druze-dominated Sweida. Damascus sent troops to the region after Druze fighters and Sunni Bedouin tribes clashed, which killed several people, including women and children. Afterwards, the country’s defence minister Murhaf Abu Qasra declared a ceasefire in the city on 15th July as government forces arrived in the morning.

The “notables and dignitaries” of the city had reached an agreement, he stated and added that government forces would “respond only to the sources of fire and deal with any targeting by outlaw groups.” Nonetheless, altercations were witnessed as did complaints of human right breaches by security personnel.

The locals accused government troops and their allies of tearing through Druze neighbourhoods. They informed AFP that the development had little impact on the ground. The interior ministry also admitted that the conflicts persisted into the evening.

On the same day, the United Kingdom-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights unveiled that 21 members of the minority group had been killed in and around the region by Syrian government forces and their aides.

According to the war monitor, the violence which broke out since early 13th July already claimed the lives of at least 248 people, comprising 92 Druze and 28 of them were civilians. The observatory previously highlighted that forces from the “defence and interior ministries carried out field executions of 12 (19 per some reports) civilians after storming the Radwan family guest house in the city of Sweida.”

It further mentioned that armed groups associated with the government were also accountable for the shooting of three siblings in the presence of their mother in Sweida province. Rayan Maarouf, the editor-in-chief of the Suwayda 24 news website revealed that security forces had been involved in “savage practices.”

He pointed out that there have been instances of brutal murders of civilians and expressed, “dozens of them, yet we do not possess accurate figures.” Suwayda 24 further informed that more than 200 people had been injured. Social media posts featured videos of armed combatants abusing Druze prisoners and shaving their beards.

The agency disclosed that the defence ministry employees took part in “systematic acts of vandalism targeting civilian homes and property” and “stealing the contents of homes, smashing doors and windows, and then setting fire to some of them” among other acts of crimes. Men in military outfits were observed robbing and burning houses as well as liquor stores.

The government troops entered the city with Bedouin fighters and accompanied them in attacking the Druze, according to the observatory, Druze leaders and witnesses. Gunfire and dead bodies laying on empty streets were reported by an AFP correspondent who landed in Sweida soon after the forces.

“Catastrophic” is how one Suweida local described the situation, adding that indiscriminate firing has caused residents to “flee towards the countryside” in spite of a curfew imposed by Syrian authorities, reported BBC Arabic.

Concern among the Druze increased when Islamist groups connected with the Syrian government joined the conflict leading a prominent member of the community to demand “international protection.” The majority of Druze religious leader also announced that they were in favour of the government’s deployment following the Bedouin violence.

However, they later called for armed resistance as the unrest escalated and voiced, “We are being subject to a total war of extermination,” and urged the Druze population “to confront this barbaric campaign with all means available.”

The authorities have been ordered to “take immediate legal action against anyone proven to have committed a transgression or abuse, regardless of their rank or position,” according to a statement released by former Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) commander and current interim president Ahmad al-Sharaa.

Tit-for-tat kidnappings and attacks between local Bedouin tribes and Druze armed forces in the southern province sparked bloodshed two days after a Druze businessman was kidnapped on the highway to Damascus. This marked the first deployment of Syrian government forces to Suweida since the Islamist-led rebels ousted President Bashar al-Assad in December.

Israel enters the conflict

Israel conveyed that after two days of deadly sectarian riots, it had targeted the government forces in the vicinity of Sweida as they moved into the largely Druze city. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu maintained that the government “intended to use (them) against the Druze.” Hence, he ordered strikes on forces and weapons in the area.

Israel with its own Druze population has promised to defend the members of the community who are living in Syria. It views any military deployment south of Damascus as a security hazard and has cautioned the Syrian government against the same. It vowed to continue the assault to protect the group.

On the other hand, the Syrian foreign ministry insisted that the strikes killed several civilians and members of the security forces, but failed to offer any exact numbers. The ministry denounced the Israeli attacks in a statement.

It termed them as “a reprehensible example of ongoing aggression and foreign interference in the internal affairs of sovereign states” and “a blatant violation of the sovereignty of the Syrian Arab Republic.”

Israel, nevertheless, complied with the Trump administration’s request to stop its strikes. The United States even deployed tanks to the troubled area. According to the country’s Syria envoy Tom Barrack, the US is communicating with all parties “to navigate towards calm and integration.”

The U.S. official claimed the Syrian government had informed Israel in advance that it was sending tanks to the Sweida area in southern Syria and stressed this was not an action directed at Israel but an attempt to restore order in internal clashes between Druze militias and a… https://t.co/a7SzPzx9AV — Barak Ravid (@BarakRavid) July 15, 2025

The recent camaraderie between Donald Trump and Ahmed al-Sharaa surprised many, as the former referred to the ex-Islamic terrorist as a “young, attractive and tough guy.” Washington even rescinded the $10 million bounty on his head and removed sanctions placed on Syria.

With the overthrow of Assad regime, the Jewish state has adopted a tough posture towards Syria’s new authorities, arguing it does not want terrorists along its borders. Israeli forces have executed hundreds of airstrikes on Syrian military targets and taken control of a United Nations-patrolled buffer zone on Syrian territory near the Golan Heights border.

Who are the minority Druze community

The majority of the nearly one million members of the Druze Arab sect reside in Syria, Lebanon and Israel. The group which originated in Egypt in the eleventh century, is an offshoot of Ismailism, branch of Shia Islam that forbids marriages and conversions to or from the faith.

The Druze are mostly found in three major provinces in the southern part of Syria, near the Israeli-ruled Golan Heights. They primarily reside in the Sweida province and a few Damascus suburbs, especially in Ashrafiyat Sahnaya and Jaramana to the south.

The Golan Heights, a strategically located plateau that Israel annexed in 1981 after capturing it from Syria during the 1967 Six-Day War is inhabited by around 20,000 Druze. There are about 25,000 Jews also staying in over 30 villages on the territory.

When Israel took over Golan, the majority of the Druze who identify as Syrian, turned down an offer of Israeli citizenship. Israeli residency cards were issued to those who declined although they are not regarded as the country’s citizens.

There is a Druze diaspora outside of the Middle East, especially in North America and Australia. Their population was expected to be over 700,000 until Syria’s civil conflict broke out in 2011. The Druze have been migrating to southern Syria since the 16th century, to what is now known as Jabal al-Druze or Druze Mountain in Sweida province, according to historian Sami Makarem’s book “The Druze Faith.”

During the ten-year civil war, the Druze who form the majority in the Suwayda region in southern Syria were pushed between the forces of the previous Assad administration and extremist organisations. Druze militias had retained a strong hold on Suweida, resisting appeals to join the security forces.

As the nation then took pride in its secular and Arab nationalist system, religious freedom was ensured under the strict control of the Assad family. Ahmed al-Sharaa also promised to safeguard them, however, his government is regarded with suspicion by them and other minorities.

The new 23-member Syrian cabinet unveiled in late March only featured one Druze member, Minister of Agriculture Amjad Badr, despite the transitional government’s commitment to incorporate minorities, including the Druze.

Earlier, many Druze citizens were slain including extrajudicially, as a result of sectarian warfare against their militias by Syrian transitional government armed forces and associated outfits that started on 28th April. Likewise, Christian and Alawite minority communities faced severe persecution few months after the new administration took charge.

Ahmed al-Sharaa’s ties to terrorism

The war name of Ahmed al-Sharaa was Abu Mohammad al-Jawlani. The United States classified him as a terrorist and the United Nations (UN) proscribed him. Over the past 20 years, he held significant positions in global terrorist organisations like Al Qaeda and ISIS. He was designated a global terrorist in 2013.

He collaborated closely with ISIS chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and Al Qaeda’s Aiman al-Zawahiri. He was instructed by the former to start a local outfit to provide a front for Al Qaeda Iraq and Syria during the 2011 uprising against the Assad regime. The Al-Nusrah Front also called Jabhat al-Nusrah or Jabhat Fatah al-Sham was founded by him in 2012.

This UN-designated terrorist group was officially acknowledged as the Syrian branch of Al Qaeda. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham or HTS became the new name for the Jabhat Fatah al-Sham in 2017. Its main objectives were to overthrow the Assad government and establish an Islamic Caliphate.

The group spearheaded a swift and widespread assault and seized areas which were under the Assad government. Afterward, retaliatory killings became rampant in Syria following Ahmed al-Sharaa’s takeover as his Sunni hardliner supporters and radicals targeted people from minority communities.

Therefore, while some Druze opposed Bashar al-Assad’s dictatorial government, they are also wary of Ahmed al-Sharaa, an Islamist leader with a history of perpetrating Islamic jihad. Reservations about some of their leaders being left out of his national discussion processes have been presented by them.",began localised tribal scuffle southern syria snowballed full blown

OpIndia,14/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/keeladi-excavation-controversy-over-the-asi-report-by-amarnath-ramakrishna-why-is-the-tn-govt-at-loggerheads-with-asi-and-centre-over-it/,Keeladi excavation and controversy over the ASI report by Amarnath Ramakrishna: Why is the TN govt at loggerheads with ASI and Centre over it,"The excavation at Keeladi, located in Tamil Nadu, unveiled proof of an early urbanized society in South India, which captivated the interest of the whole nation. The first stages of the initiative, started in 2014, were headed by archaeologist K Amarnath Ramakrishna.

However, a significant political dispute between the Tamil Nadu government and the centre has unfolded by his repeated transfers and the Archaeological Survey of India’s (ASI) reservations about his excavation report.

K Amarnath is now appointed as the Director of the National Mission on Monuments and Antiquity (NMMA) in Greater Noida. He was employed as the Director of the National Mission on Monuments and Antiquity in New Delhi prior to the transfer, which occurred six months after his last assignment. He had previously spent three months in the position of Director for Excavation and Exploration.

K Amarnath was ordered to modify his report by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), however, he denied to comply, leading to a fierce war of words between the central and state governments.

How it all began: The Keeladi findings and its significance

Keeladi also known as Keezhadi is on the Vaigai river basin, situated in the Sivaganga district, approximately 12 kilometers southeast of Madurai. Excavations were started more than ten years ago at the Pallichanthai Tidal in Keeladi which was once a 100-acre coconut grove by Amarnath Ramakrishna, the ASI’s superintending archaeologist at the time. Keeladi stood out among the over 100 locations he had selected for excavation along the Vaigai River.

Over 7,500 ancient artefacts, such as wells, drainage systems and wall structures were discovered there, pointing to a thriving and advanced urban society. These materials were disclosed to be more than 2,160 years old, dating to the second century BCE (Before Common Era) which coincides with Tamil history’s Sangam period, according to carbon dating.

The ASI conducted the first three of the eight rounds of excavations. After the Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology (TNSDA) assumed responsibility for the project, the artefacts accumulated to over 18,000, which included pottery, inscribed potsherds, gold ornaments, copper articles, semi-precious stones, shell and ivory bangles, glass beads, spindle whorls, terracotta seals, and weaving tools.

The location produced more than 120 potsherds with Tamil Brahmi inscriptions. The discovery alongside thousand inscribed potsherds from other areas demonstrated the script’s continued existence in the region. Copper needles, clay seals, spinning whorls, yarn hanging stones, terracotta spheres, and earthen containers for liquids alluded to different stages of the weaving industry.

They also indicated that Keeladi was a strong, well-planned and sophisticated urban community with traces of businesses like beadmaking, dyeing and pottery. The artistic, culturally diverse and affluent lifestyle of the Keeladi people is reflected in gold decorations, copper objects, semi-precious stones, shell bangles, ivory bangles and ivory combs.

Beads made of carnelian and agate reflected importation through business networks. Furthermore, their recreational interests had been disclosed through the uncovering of terracotta and ivory dice, gamesmen and signs of hopscotch which also revealed the presence of an elite society. It was also unearthed that the area’s fertility and cow husbandry were key factors in its development, opening the door for the locals to engage in sea trading and produce an abundance of rice.

The results showcased a far older and more developed civilisation than previously believed, pushing the Sangam Age in Tamil Nadu back to about 800 BCE, as per reports. The Sangam Age, also known as the Tamil Sangam period, is a significant period in the history of South India. It was named for the Sangam, an assembly of Tamil poets and academics, saw a flourishing of literature and culture in southern India. It was generally accepted to have occurred between approximately 300 BCE and 300 CE (Common Era).

The Keeladi objects displayed certain symbols that were similar to those of the Indus Valley Civilization. However, there is cultural separation of roughly 1,000 years and scholars anticipated that more research would shed light on this relationship.

Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology asserted that Keeladi possessed all the hallmarks of an urban civilisation, including brick buildings, upscale goods and evidence of both domestic and international trade. It presented itself as a highly developed and hard-working civilisation and provided proof of Tamil Nadu’s urban life and settlements throughout the Early Historic Period. Additionally, Keeladi only strengthened Sangam Literature’s legitimacy.

Strong structures orientated in cardinal directions unveiled systematic urban planning and pot fragments with Tamil Brahmi inscriptions confirmed a literate culture. The sun and moon graffiti revealed the people’s astronomical awareness.

Keeladi was an urban town from the Sangam era and the cultural deposits discovered during the fourth phase of excavations could be easily dated to a time between the sixth and first centuries BCE, according to a 2019 report from the Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology. One of the six samples sent to the United States for carbon testing was dated 580 BCE. It was taken at a depth of 353 centimetres.

Notably, according to the findings presented in the report, the Keeladi artefacts date back approximately 300 years earlier than the previously believed 3rd century BCE.

Ramakrishna’s discovery and subsequent transfer

Keeladi was found by Amarnath Ramakrishna, who supervised the first two seasons of excavations from 2014 to 2016 and handed over a 982-page report to ASI Director General V. Vidyavathi. The report’s twelve chapters provided an explanation of the excavation’s goals and historical context.

The 23 samples that were dated using Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) at the Beta Analytical Lab in Florida of the United States were covered in a different chapter. It also incorporated research on floral and faunal remains from the site to arrive at the period, as well as discoveries from other universities, as per reports.

The first two phases of excavation at Keeladi yielded about 5,800 artefacts after which Ramakrishna was transferred to Assam. The action was reportedly viewed as a setback to the effort. The centre was accused by critics of purposefully sabotaging the excavations because it had committed to release funds and support for additional digging, but postponed both.

Meanwhile, the excavations had already progressed into their third phase under archaeologist PS Sriraman. Interestingly, Sriraman announced that there was no continuity in the brick constructions that had been found earlier, after 400 square meters of excavation. As a result, claims emerged from Tamil Nadu that the centre was actively ‘downplaying’ Keeladi’s prominence, aided by the usual political narratives of anti-North India sentiments that is seen in Tamil political discourse.

TN Govt took up excavation project after ASI stopped, found 13,000 more items

The ASI halted excavations at the site, arguing that the third phase produced no significant outcomes. However, the work was taken over by the Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology in 2017 and thousands of artefacts have since been unearthed. The ninth phase of the excavations was launched by Chief Minister MK Stalin in April 2023 and ended in September of the same year.

The Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology has been able to uncover more than 13,000 items and acquire radiocarbon dates from 580 BCE to 200 CE. The excavations, entered their tenth phase by 2024-2025 and already produced hundreds of antiques.

Furthermore, a 30-foot-long new structure has recently been found at the third trench of the Keeladi excavation after ASI ruled out the possibility of any noteworthy discovery at the site. The bricks used in this new structure are identical in design and make to those used in other parts.

“The bricks used in this new structure are identical in design and make to those used in other parts of Keeladi, strengthening the authenticity of the findings. Earlier studies by Amarnath Ramakrishna’s team had already suggested the area might have housed industrial zones,” V Marappan, Professor of History at Presidency College, outlined while talking to The Federal.

He added, “These new findings raise questions about whether other sections of the site remain unexcavated underground.” The new structure, east-west orientated was discovered 90 centimetres below the surface on the western side. Its length is estimated to be approximately 10 meters. According to archaeologists, it might have been an industrial building or a workshop.

Madras High Court intervenes

The matter made its way to the judiciary in the interim. Judges from the Madras High Court intervened and travelled to the excavation site. They asked the ASI to carry on with the excavations and permit the involvement of the Tamil Nadu Department of Archaeology. The archaeology department of the state followed the instruction.

It had been working on it since the third phase of excavation, giving a more dramatic turn to the events. The court’s Madurai bench in 2019 pronounced that the excavations should not stop since significant advancements in Tamil civilisation had been uncovered while considering a number of petitions that sought an order to the state and the centre to preserve the archaeological sites in Tamil Nadu.

The public would learn more about Tamil civilisation through the archaeological excavations, thus Division Bench consisting of Justices D. Krishnakumar and R. Vijayakumar advised the relevant authorities to ensure that they were carried out without any obstacles.

The court even ordered the centre to send back Amarnath Ramakrishna to Tamil Nadu within 15 days to continue the excavations. Amarnath Ramakrishna, who had been moved back to the state, put forth his report on the first two stages of excavation in January 2023.

Last year, the High Court even sent a notice to the centre demanding the ASI to release the report that was provided following the first two stages of the excavations. The centre received notice regarding the petition filed by Madurai resident P. Prabhakar Pandian from the bench.

The state and the centre were also instructed to submit more counter-affidavits to several public interest litigation petitions concerning the excavations, in the same year. It ordered the authorities to present the rebuttal affidavits to the 2016 and 2017 petitions which had asked the relevant authorities for guidance on how to proceed with the excavations at Keeladi rather than shutting down the site.

One of the petitions asked the government to establish a “site museum” at Keeladi. Stalin opened a Rs 18.43 crore Keeladi museum in March 2023 on two acres.

The Madurai bench even granted the Archaeological Survey India’s request to relocate the artefacts from the excavation to its Dehradun lab for further scientific analysis, in 2016. It was instructed to notify the state’s archaeology commissioner prior to the move. The commissioner was told to record videos and take pictures of the items. The ASI was given directions to return the objects to Tamil Nadu and provide a report to the court.

Controversy erupts between the Centre, Tamil Nadu govt

The 982-page final report was given by Ramakrishna in January 2023, following preliminary and interim submissions in 2016 and 2017, respectively. It had been with the ASI for almost two and a half years and it wrote to Ramakrishna in May seeking a revision.

The Archaeological Survey of India raised concerns regarding the dating and profoundity of specific outcomes. It underscored that the evidence for the earliest period seemed to be quite early and stated that it needed further examination.

According to the letter, “the three periods require proper nomenclatures or re-orientation.” It remarked that the “8th century BCE to 5th century BCE for Period I requires concrete justification.” It also noted that “just mentioning depth for the available scientific dates is not enough but the layer number should also be marked for comparative consistency analysis.” The ASI also demanded that the manner in which dates were presented should also be amended.

However, Amarnath Ramakrishna refused to modify his results, maintaining that his research was sound from a scientific standpoint and supported by strict archaeological standards. He maintained that material culture, stratigraphic sequences and even Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) corroborated the report’s chronology.

A number of Tamil Nadu political groups, including the ruling-Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), the Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi and historian R. Balakrishnan, denounced the ASI’s move as an attempt to stifle Tamil culture. They accused that the failure to recognise Keeladi’s importance was motivated by politics.

On the other hand, Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, the Union Minister for Culture, stated that additional scientific research was necessary to validate Ramakrishnan’s conclusions because they lacked technical support. He asserted that a single finding could not alter the entire discourse and therefore, more data, outcomes and proofs were needed to be collected.

Shekhawat stated that Tamil Nadu is a vital part of India and that its history should be honoured using knowledge based on science rather than polarising opinions. He informed Stalin that the union government would not hesitate to publish any reports and would be delighted to support the state if the research was validated by science.

The union minister declared that more convincing evidence is required for the report to be accepted by the scientific community. He even questioned was the Tamil Nadu government had been reluctant to work with the centre on this matter due to which the conflict has persisted.

“People holding such positions are trying to use that to grow regional sentiments. That is not fair. We have to be very cautious. Let archaeologists, historians, and technical experts discuss this, instead of politicians,” he mentioned.

However, Thangam Thennarasu, Tamil Nadu’s Archaeology Minister, charged that the union government treats Tamils as second-class citizens. He complained, “They also refused to allocate funds for the excavations and allowed the report to gather dust for two years. Now they say there is no adequate evidence. Every time they reject Tamil history, only the method of rejection changes.”

Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam’s (MDMK) Vaiko also claimed that the centre was attempting to promote “a non-existent Sanskrit civilisation” while repressing Tamil civilisation.

“How many obstacles do Tamils face? We have been fighting against all of them for thousands of years, and with the help of science, we have been establishing the antiquity of our race. Yet some minds refuse to accept it. It’s not the statements that need to be corrected, it’s some minds,” MK Stalin recently shared on social media last month while reacting on Ramakrishna’s recent transfer.

Communist Party of India (Marxist) MP from Madurai S Venkatesan expressed, “Transferring an official is not in itself a major issue, it is part of administrative procedures. But Amarnath Ramakrishna worked on the Keeladi excavation for eight years, without compromising on the truth. He was removed, reassigned and denied the opportunity to publish his findings. Only after court intervention was he allowed to write the report.”

He conveyed that the ASI had promised the court and Parliament that the report would be released in 11 months, but that deadline had not been fulfilled while the centre now wants more scientific proof at the final stage. “The message is clear: If you do not align with our views, this is what will be done to you. This is not just about an individual, it’s a discriminatory act against Tamil Nadu and against South Indian history itself,” he alleged.

The AIADMK (All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam) which was in power when the Keeladi report was issued, did not comment on the dispute for a long time. On 18th June, however, its senior leader and former minister RB Udhayakumar stated that the union government had requested further data in order to provide “additional corroboration.” He added that his party would be the first one to voice its disapproval if the Keeladi report was rejected.

Stalin accused the party of remaining silent while the centre minimised the importance of the location to which Udhayakumar retorted that his party’s government had approved Rs 55 lakh for the 2018 excavations. Mafoi Pandiarajan, a senior AIADMK leader who helmed archaeology under Edappadi Palaniswamy, praised him as “Keeladi Nayakar” (hero of Keeladi) and gave him credit for proving Tamil antiquity. A veteran DMK leader retaliated, “Their belated pride in Keeladi rings hollow when they put alliance politics above Tamil identity.”

Central government demands excavation report

The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has asked retired superintending archaeologist PS Sriraman to present the official excavation report for the third phase of the Keeladi excavations. He handled the short-lived third phase in 2017 after Ramakrishna’s abrupt transfer and reported that no major discoveries were made.

He retired in 2019 and has been given permission by the agency to write reports on the excavations he supervised in Keeladi, where he headed the third phase of excavations. He was also involved in the work for one season at Kodumanal which is situated on the northern banks of the Noyyal River in the Erode district, between 2017-2018.

According to archaeologists, Kodumanal could be split into two cultural periods: the Megalithic era and the Prehistoric era. During these times, the locals built durable structures, were skilled craftspeople and engaged in trade with several nations.

Sriraman would be writing the report from the ASI office in Chennai. He talked to The Hindu and revealed, “As I had retired, both reports were pending. I sought the approval of the ASI to access the material and prepare the reports. Since all the related materials are in Chennai, I will begin preparing the reports soon.”

He reiterated, “I have sought permission to complete the report since I am retired now. A formal communication from the ASI is expected soon,” while speaking with Deccan Herald. “The ASI instructed me to complete as quickly as possible. I am concentrating more on Kodumanal because it is an individual work – my work while the third phase in Keezhadi is for a shorter period and it was a continuation of work done earlier,” he asserted in conversation with The New Indian Express.

This comes more than a month after Ramakrishna was asked by the ASI to “resubmit” his report following the necessary changes recommended by two experts who reviewed it.

New dawn in India’s history: Traces of parallel civilization

The Keeladi site has unveiled a pivotal chapter in the history of Tamil Nadu. The indication that an artifact belonged to the 6th century BCE by the US laboratory Beta Analytics holds a major significance. They used the method of radiocarbon dating and suggested that it was contemporary with the urbanisation of the Gangetic plains.

The oldest of the 29 radiocarbon samples dated by the Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology since the 2017-18 excavation season was 580 BCE and the most recent was 200 CE. The results indicated that between the sixth century BCE and the second century CE, there was a vibrant urban and industrial civilisation that lasted for 800 years.

Large brick buildings from the Sangam Age had been discovered and provided proof of the development discussed in Sangam literature. Archaeologist K Rajan who is advisor to Tamil Nadu’s archaeology department voiced, “Most samples above the brick structures date to after the 3rd century BCE, while those below go as far back as the 6th century BCE,” reported The Times of India.

With the use of 3D technology and anthropometric measurements from a skull discovered at the Kondagai burial site, archaeologists are one step closer to unveiling the face of the ancient Tamil people who inhabited the Keeladi settlement thousands of years ago. Rajan stated, “Based on the skull, we will reconstruct the age, dietary pattern, determine the gender, and actual face of the person.”

He added, “This places Keeladi alongside the urbanisation of the Gangetic plains, India’s second urbanisation. Of the 29 radiocarbon dates, 12 fall in the pre-Ashokan era, before the 3rd century BCE.”

Over 20 research institutions from India and abroad are working with the state archaeology department to recreate life in Keeladi in 580 BCE. These involve Liverpool University in the United Kingdom, the University of Pisa in Italy, the Field Museum in Chicago, the French Institute of Pondicherry, IIT Gandhinagar and Deccan College.

Animal bones discovered in Keeladi are under examination at the Deccan College. The bones of bulls, buffaloes, goats, cows, sheep, dogs, pigs, antelope and spotted deer were located during excavations. Researchers at Madurai Kamaraj University are looking into ancient animal and human DNA in order to gain further insight into the mixing and human migration of the ancient residents of Keeladi and Kondagai, a Keeladi cluster hamlet.

A single site has produced 29 dates applying this scientific method. “It shows Keeladi was an urban settlement with a literate society and a community of artisans. It was an industrial hub along an ancient trade route linking the east coast port of Alagankulam to Muziris on the west coast via Madurai,” mentioned R Sivanandam, joint director of state archaeology department.

However, the settlement’s original name is still unknown. Towns, streets, palace structures, decorations, gemstones and international trade are part of Sangam literature. “Keeladi has proved that Sangam literature was a lived experience of ancient Tamils and not imaginative stories,” conveyed indologist R Balakrishnan.

At the site, archaeologists uncovered rectangular and cubic pieces of clay and ivory dice that, according to Balakrishnan, are referenced in “Kalithogai” the sixth of the eight anthologies of Sangam literature.

Rajan emphasised, “Keeladi isn’t the only site with roots in the 6th century BCE. Kodumanal, Porunthal, Sivagalai, Adichanallur and Korkai have also yielded dates from that period. Korkai has produced a date as early as 785 BCE, suggesting Sangam-age urbanisation was widespread.”

Only 4% of the 110 acres of cultural deposit at Keeladi have been unearthed by researchers in ten seasons of excavation. The state government intends to execute further excavations and has established a museum to display the discoveries. There are also plans for an on-site museum which will be the first of its sort in the country.

“Tamil Nadu has endured archaeological apathy for far too long until Keeladi sparked a wave of interest among Tamils,” complained Balakrishnan. Rajan expressed, “Keeladi is the first site that transformed the understanding of archaeology in Tamil Nadu.”

Faces from Keeladi

Meanwhile, a first-of-its-kind forensic facial reconstruction project coordinated by experts from Madurai Kamaraj University and Liverpool John Moores University restored the faces of two individuals who lived in the Keeladi region more than 2,500 years ago. Researchers described the facial features as South Indian with signs of ancient Austro-Asiatic people and West Eurasian (Iranian) hunter-gatherers.

The skulls were discovered around 800 meters from the main excavation site at Kondagai, a burial site. They added that more DNA research is required to identify the genetic ancestry.

Professor Caroline Wilkinson, director of Face Lab at Liverpool John Moores University informed, “We used a computer-assisted 3D facial reconstruction system to rebuild the facial musculature and estimate facial features following anatomical and anthropometrical standards. . As the lower jaws of the skulls were missing, we used orthodontic standards to estimate the shapes of the mandibles from cranial measurements and planes,” according to a report in The Times of India.

According to professor G Kumaresan of Madurai Kamaraj University’s genetics department which scanned and sent pictures of the skulls to Liverpool, “It is 80% science and 20% art.” He outlined that the DNA information and the recreated faces could be useful in determining the lineage of Tamils who lived during the Sangam era.

Critical moment in India’s civilisational journey

The 90-by-60-meter excavated area contains artefacts like as dice, unidentified copper coins, glass, shell, ivory, pearl, and terracotta beads, seals and gold decorations. More importantly, it is one of the few locations in Tamil Nadu, along with Arikamedu, Kaveripattinam and Korkai, to produce a broad range of structures, including intricate brick constructions, tank-like drainage systems, double-walled furnaces and terracotta ring wells.

All of this not only indicates a vibrant, literate and successful urbanized community but also emphasizes the advanced nature of Indian civilization. Its origins trace back to the timeline of the Gangetic plains which also illuminate how India has been home to not just one but multiple prime civilizations and flourishing communities residing in both the northern and southern regions of this vast country for many centuries. Furthermore, the discoveries indicated that they were also linked to the external world.

Such developments not only reinforce the deep civilizational roots of this ancient country but also aid in comprehending the elements of our age-old society. The myths surrounding foreigners who landed in the country and established their communities are also debunked by these revelations, which confirm that the nation has been the cradle of multiple ancient advanced settlements displaying city planning, trade, leisure and all indications of a vibrant cultural society.

These discoveries are therefore not merely a matter of pride but are crucial in preserving our civilizational foundations, comprehending and sustaining a continuous connection with our past, as well as understanding our background. Certainly, the sophisticated perspective of our forebears and the societies they formed and preserved over centuries is truly a subject of admiration.

Intellectuals, historians, epigraphists, geologists and archaeology aficionados have all been drawn to Keeladi to analyse the historical relevance it provides to society and it has even prompted several research investigations.

The procession is conducted by the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) every year. The 80 KM long procession began at 12 PM.

Security arrangements for 2025 Yatra

Amidst all the chaos, Aaj Tak’s anchor Neha Batham made a controversial statement during reporting on the preparations for the Braj Mandal Jalabhishek Yatra.

Media coverage and controversial remarks

While talking to the on-ground reporter, Neha questioned why the procession was allowed when there were chances of communal tension. She said, “When such incident happened in 2023, what was the need of the procession? After all, peace is the top priority.” Interestingly, during the reporting, on-ground reporter Anmol Vali and Neha avoided mentioning that the 2023 riots were caused by an Muslim mob.

Narrative distortion and omission of facts

Anmol mentioned that Bittu Bajrangi has been stopped from attending the procession and claimed he was accused of causing the riots. He also mentioned that weapons like “Trishul”, “baseball bat”, have been banned from the procession. However, he completely ignored the fact that it was the Muslim mob that attacked Hindus, police personnel and home guards in 2023. He completely ignored the fact that Muslims had pelted stones, attacked Hindus with sticks and batons and opened fire at them.

Aaj Tak’s reporters conveniently ignored mentioning Abhishek, who was brutally murdered. He was first shot at, then his throat was slit and his face crushed with stones. They did not mention how shops belonging to Hindus were selectively looted and torched in Nuh and nearby regions.

Nuh violence of 2023

On 31st July 2023, during the procession, large mobs of Muslims had attacked Hindus, leading to massive chaos. Seven people had lost their lives and several were injured. Public and police vehicles were torched. Shops were looted and burnt down.

A Hindu youth named Abhishek was brutally murdered by the Muslim mob at the Shiv temple premises. He was shot and his head was crushed, leaving no chance of survival. A female judicial officer who was going back home with her 3-year-old daughter was attacked by the Muslims. Her vehicle was torched. She somehow managed to escape.

Police action in 2023 and preventive measures in following years

Following the attack on Hindus, Haryana police filed over 60 FIRs and over 400 Muslims were arrested, most of whom are now out on bail. All the cases filed in the matter are under trial. The following year, the Haryana government was prepared. Internet was shut down. Heavy police force was deployed to avoid any unwanted incidents.

For the 2025 Yatra, similar arrangements were made. Over 2,500 police personnel were deployed. Internet services were shut down for the day. Notably, Nuh district is Muslim-dominant, making it a hotbed for communal tension. Sniffer dogs and drones have been deployed for surveillance.

Media bias and its consequences

The selective amnesia displayed by mainstream media outlets is not just irresponsible, it is dangerous. They conveniently glossed over the real perpetrators of the 2023 violence and cast doubt on a peaceful religious procession. They feed into a narrative that vilifies Hindu devotees while downplaying Muslim aggression.

Lazar, who lost his family members including parents and sister in the Khalistani terror attack decades ago, wrote an X post sharing his article regarding the June 2025 Ahmedabad Air India 171 Boeing Dreamliner tragedy that claimed around 240 lives.

What started as a usual social media exchange over Lazar tagging several activists and journalists in his post, Congress supporter Suryanarayan Ganesh claimed that Lazar made money off Kanishka ‘disaster’. The pro-Congress troll accused Sanjay Lazar of exploiting the Ahmedabad Air crash as a career opportunity by peddling conspiracy theories.

“You are the one who wrote and sold books to make money off Kanishka disaster, now you see this one as another career opportunity by spewing conspiracy bullshit that flies against evidence seen so far,” Ganesh wrote.

However, the Congress supporter’s vile comment did not go unanswered as Sanjay Lazar not only called out Suryanarayan Ganesh for mocking him without knowing much about his career, but also pointed out how the previous Congress government refused to do anything ensure justice to the victims of Air Kanishka bombing.

Air Kanishka bombing

On 23rd June 1985, Air India Flight 182, named Kanishka, disintegrated mid-air off the coast of Ireland after a bomb exploded in its cargo hold. There were 329 people on board, including the passengers and crew members, who were killed. Out of these, 268 were Canadians. Khalistani terrorists were behind the attack that still remains the worst terrorist attack in Canadian history.

Around one hour before the Kanishka bombing, a related suitcase bomb destined for another Air India flight blew up at Japan’s Narita Airport, killing two baggage handlers. Khalistani terrorists were behind both the blasts.

Sneha had been reported missing since July 7, sparking a widespread search and intense concern from her family and authorities. Sneha, originally from Sabroom, Tripura, was last in contact with her family early on July 7. In her final call to her mother, she mentioned she was heading to Sarai Rohilla Railway Station with a friend named Pitunia to drop her.

However, Pitunia later confirmed she never met Sneha that morning, deepening the mystery surrounding her disappearance. The family traced the driver of cab booked by Sneha that morning, who revealed that he had dropped Sneha near Delhi’s Signature Bridge, a location notorious for safety concerns and lack of CCTV cameras, severely hampering the investigation.

The search intensified with the involvement of NDRF, conducting operations over a seven-kilometer radius, but initially yielded no results for days.

Sneha’s family noted she had not withdrawn any money in the past four months and left without any belongings, except her phone, which was later found switched off. She had a small balance in her bank account, which remained unchanged. This raised alarming questions about her state of mind and circumstances leading to her disappearance.

A distressing development came to light when a note, written in Sneha’s handwriting, was discovered in her Delhi residence. The note read, “I just feel like a failure and burden and it was getting unbearable to live like this. I had decided to end my life by jumping from Signature Bridge. There is no foul play involved; it was my decision.”

The Delhi Police have stated that the investigation is ongoing, with no foul play suspected at this stage, but they are exploring all angles to understand the full circumstances of her death.",day 19 year old sneha debnath student atma ram sanatan dharma college delhi university went missing body recovered river geeta colony flyover sunday body discovered following extensive search operation delhi police national disaster response force ndrf update delhi female body located police team geeta colony flyover river age deceased girl confirmed 19 year delhi police age deceased girl confirmed 19 year 24 year told the… — ani ani july 13 2025 sneha reported missing since july 7 sparking widespread search intense concern family authority sneha originally sabroom tripura last contact family early july 7 final call mother mentioned heading sarai rohilla railway station friend named pitunia drop however pitunia later confirmed never met sneha morning deepening mystery surrounding disappearance family traced driver cab booked sneha morning revealed dropped sneha near delhi’s signature bridge location notorious safety concern lack cctv camera severely hampering investigation search intensified involvement ndrf conducting operation seven kilometer radius initially yielded result day sneha’s family noted withdrawn money past four month left without belonging except phone later found switched small balance bank account remained unchanged raised alarming question state mind circumstance leading disappearance distressing development came light note written sneha’s handwriting discovered delhi residence note read “i feel like failure burden getting unbearable live like decided end life jumping signature bridge foul play involved decision ” delhi police stated investigation ongoing foul play suspected stage exploring angle understand full circumstance death

They made the announcement during a protest rally on the medical college ground.

“Patients should not feel unsafe while seeking treatment, and we should not attend classes in fear,” a student said, warning that the shutdown would persist unless demands—including banning outsiders, clearing makeshift shops, enhanced Ansar presence, and improved security—were met.

On 9 July 2025, around 6:00 pm, the 39-year-old scrap trader Lal Chand (alias Sohag) was brutally attacked outside Gate No. 3 of Mitford Hospital. CCTV footage and witness accounts show that assailants used bricks, concrete blocks, iron rods, sticks, and stones to beat him. His head and body were crushed, he was stripped naked, and some attackers were seen stomping on his body even after he fell unconscious and died. The attackers reportedly celebrated afterwards by dancing around the body.

The murder is believed to have been fuelled by a business dispute and attempts to extort Tk 2 lakh per month from him, which he had refused, according to the victim’s family.

Victim mistakenly identified as Hindu

Notably, several Indian media reports claimed that Lal Chand was Hindu. Headlines in reports of NDTV, India Today and several other media houses said that he was a Hindu. But actually, he was Muslim, and his mortal remains were buried his mother’s grave in a family graveyard in Islampur village. Moreover, the names of his family members reported by Bangladeshi media reveal that he was a Muslim.

His father was Ayub Ali, who died in a lightning strike when Sohag was seven months old. His mother is Aleya Begum, who moved to Dhaka with her children to earn a livelihood, after her husband’s death.

Lal Chand’s sister is Sajeda Begum, and his wife is Lucky Begum, while the name of his one uncle is Md Montu Mia. His two children are named Sohan and Sohana, and he had named his shop Sohana Metal.

It is now known why Lal Chand was identified as Hindu by several media reports. Perhaps, it was assumed that Lal Chand is a Hindu name.

Gang killed Lal Chand for not paying monthly amount

Both the sister and the wife said that a criminal gang had been extorting Tk 2 lakh monthly from the shop for years. But Sohag had refused to make the payment. On Wednesday, the gang members lured him out of his home, detained him, and then lynched him near the hospital gate.

Sohag’s sister Sajeda Begum said, “My brother ran his business for 10-15 years. The gang demanded Tk 2 lakh every month and even tried to seize his business. When he refused, they called him out, beat him, and stoned him to death.” Similarly, his wife Lucky Begum said, “They couldn’t tolerate my husband’s success. They demanded Tk 2 lakh monthly, and when he refused, they killed him.” She demanded capital punishment for the culprits.

Similarly, Bithi Akter, Lal Chand’s niece, stated, “The accused had asked my uncle to give them Tk 2 lakh and a portion of his income every month. My uncle did not agree, and for this, they killed him so brutally”. She also alleged that some of the accused are members of Jubo Dal, the youth wing of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).

Some suspects belong to various wings of BNP

A total of five suspects have been arrested in the case so far, Mahmudul Hasan Mohin (41), named the prime suspect, Tarek Rahman Robin (22), Alamgir (28) Monir alias Lomba Monir (32), and Titon Gazi (32). A pistol was recovered from Robin.

A murder case, listing 19 named accused and 15-20 unidentified individuals, was filed at Kotwali Police Station by Lal Chand’s sister Monjuara Begum.

Some of the accused are members of various wings of Bangladesh Nationalist Party. BNP has expelled five people involved in the crime from Jubo Dal, Swechchhasebak Dal, and Chhatra Dal.

In a move described by officials as a “delicate balance between costs, climate and compliance,” the decision is expected to lower electricity tariffs by 25–30 paise per unit for consumers.

The union govt has issued a gazette notification restricting the previous universal mandate from 2015 that required all coal plants to install flue-gas desulphurisation (FGD) systems. These systems remove Sulphur dioxide (SO₂) from exhaust gases emitted by coal-fired thermal power plants.

As per modified rules, only plants within a 10-kilometre radius of cities with populations exceeding one million are required to install FGDs. This means nearly 79% of India’s coal power capacity—those in less sensitive zones—will be exempt from this requirement. Plants located in critically polluted or non-attainment cities will be assessed individually.

The notification cited findings from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), which noted that the existing control measures contributs to higher carbon dioxide emissions. “This is not a rollback. It is a recalibration based on evidence,” a senior government official explained. “Our approach is now targeted, efficient and climate-conscious.”

The policy has been revised based on detailed studies conducted by institutions such as IIT Delhi, CSIR-NEERI, and the National Institute of Advanced Studies (NIAS). These studies showed that ambient Sulphur Dioxide concentrations across most Indian cities fall well below the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) limit of 80 micrograms per cubic meter, and it typically ranged between 3 and 20 micrograms.

Indian coal, which has a relatively low Sulphur content of under 0.5%, along with the presence of tall stacks and favourable atmospheric conditions, aids in the effective dispersion of SO₂. As per experts, these factors reduce the need for widespread FGD installations.

One key concern addressed by the studies is the unintended environmental impact of retrofitting FGDs nationwide. The NIAS projected that such an effort would add 69 million tonnes of CO₂ between 2025 and 2030 due to increased mining of limestone, its transport, and additional energy consumption.

Industry leaders have praised the new framework. “This is a rational, science-based move that avoids unnecessary costs and focuses regulation where it is most needed,” said a senior executive at a major public-sector utility. “More importantly, it will help keep electricity affordable.”

The financial implications of mandatory retrofitting had raised alarms within the power sector. Earlier estimates placed the cost of FGD installations at over ₹2.5 lakh crore, or ₹1.2 crore per megawatt, with each unit requiring up to 45 days of downtime. Power producers warned that this could disrupt grid stability, especially during peak demand seasons.

Officials emphasised that environmental protection remains a priority, but must be approached with practicality. “This is a smarter lens, not a weakening of standards,” one official reiterated.

The government plans to submit an affidavit to the Supreme Court in the ongoing MC Mehta vs Union of India case, outlining the scientific basis and expected benefits of the revised FGD norms, which have been under judicial review.",union government announced significant policy shift easing sulphur emission norm coal fired power plant move described official “delicate balance cost climate compliance ” decision expected lower electricity tariff 25–30 paisa per unit consumer union govt issued gazette notification restricting previous universal mandate 2015 required coal plant install flue gas desulphurisation fgd system system remove sulphur dioxide so₂ exhaust gas emitted coal fired thermal power plant per modified rule plant within 10 kilometre radius city population exceeding one million required install fgds mean nearly 79 india’s coal power capacity—those less sensitive zones—will exempt requirement plant located critically polluted non attainment city assessed individually notification cited finding central pollution control board cpcb noted existing control measure contributs higher carbon dioxide emission “this rollback recalibration based evidence ” senior government official explained “our approach targeted efficient climate conscious ” policy revised based detailed study conducted institution iit delhi csir neeri national institute advanced study nias study showed ambient sulphur dioxide concentration across indian city fall well national ambient air quality standard naaqs limit 80 microgram per cubic meter typically ranged 3 20 microgram indian coal relatively low sulphur content 0 5 along presence tall stack favourable atmospheric condition aid effective dispersion so₂ per expert factor reduce need widespread fgd installation one key concern addressed study unintended environmental impact retrofitting fgds nationwide nias projected effort would add 69 million tonne co₂ 2025 2030 due increased mining limestone transport additional energy consumption industry leader praised new framework “this rational science based move avoids unnecessary cost focus regulation needed ” said senior executive major public sector utility “more importantly help keep electricity affordable ” financial implication mandatory retrofitting raised alarm within power sector earlier estimate placed cost fgd installation ₹2 5 lakh crore ₹1 2 crore per megawatt unit requiring 45 day downtime power producer warned could disrupt grid stability especially peak demand season official emphasised environmental protection remains priority must approached practicality “this smarter lens weakening standard ” one official reiterated government plan submit affidavit supreme court ongoing mc mehta v union india case outlining scientific basis expected benefit revised fgd norm judicial review

The matter came to light after she approached the local police with her family, leading to protests by members of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP).

Both met through social media

According to the woman, she met the man on social media in 2021. He introduced himself as Azad Singh, a Hindu from Kiranw village, and even showed her an Aadhaar card with that name. The two developed a relationship, and eventually, she eloped with him. They got married, and though her father filed a kidnapping complaint at the time, police didn’t take action since both were adults.

Later, the woman said that the man took her to Chandigarh. It was only after moving there that she found out his real name is Ejaz and that he is a Muslim. Soon after, Ejaz left for Saudi Arabia to work as a driver, and she returned to her parents’ home. During this time, she gave birth to their daughter, who is now four years old.

I was never Hindu: Ejaz

About 20 days ago, Ejaz returned from Saudi and met her. That’s when things turned ugly. The woman said Ejaz confessed that he was never Hindu and said that if she wanted to stay with him, she would have to convert to Islam. He told her to perform namaz daily and renamed her ‘Ania Bano’. When she refused, he also beat her and threatened to kill her if she or their daughter didn’t convert.

Scared and confused, she told everything to her family, who then took her to the police station. VHP workers also reached the station and demanded strict action. A case has now been registered against Ejaz.

Her father said, “He lied to my daughter to marry her with a fake identity, and now he’s threatening her life to force a religious conversion.”

Rewarding the deserving

Since PM Modi assumed office in 2014, the recognition system in India has undergone a significant transformation. There was a time when Padma awards had become a way to “honour” the loyalists. However, the approach has changed to celebrate those who actively promote India’s civilisational heritage. The same has happened with the nominations to the Rajya Sabha and appointments to different offices.

The recognition now often extends beyond political or bureaucratic achievements to those who are champions of India’s cultural, spiritual, and ideological identity. This shift can be seen in the increasing nominations to key positions like the Rajya Sabha, where figures promoting the values of Indian heritage are now receiving greater recognition.

One of the most notable changes has been the growing emphasis on individuals connected to the RSS or associated ideologies. Figures like Meenakshi Jain and C. Sadanandan Master, who were recently nominated to the Rajya Sabha, reflect this changing focus.

Their contributions in preserving India’s cultural identity and their ideological alignment with nationalistic causes have earned them prestigious recognitions. It is a deliberate move to honour individuals who are seen as preserving India’s traditional values, rather than simply acknowledging political service.

Furthermore, the changing nature of recognition under PM Modi’s leadership is also apparent in the rise of figures like Sadhvi Rithambara, Swami Rambhadracharya, and others, who have been recognised for their efforts to strengthen India’s spiritual and cultural foundation. This reflects a broader ideological turn in India’s national honours, where the focus has gradually shifted to honouring individuals who are shaping the cultural and spiritual narrative of the country. The increasing recognition of these figures is an acknowledgment of their significant role in redefining the nation’s identity on the global stage.",past decade india’s recognition system evolved

A resident of Assam’s Bongaigaon district, Karim had molested at least seven girls, aged 5 to 7, staying at the hostel of the Mount Carmel School.

The child molester was detained by police on Thursday (10th July), but tensions erupted over the next day.

Parents and locals dragged him out of the station and beat him severely. Even after police took him to a hospital, the angry locals thrashed him again, leading to his death.

“The body was handed over to the contractor today after post-mortem and other necessary formalities. It was later sent to Assam with a police escort,” the SP said.

A case has been filed at Roing Police Station under Section 329(4)/75(2) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita(BNS) and Sections 10 and 12 of the POCSO Act, and the investigation is ongoing.

School shut down temporarily

Mount Carmel School in Roing of Arunachal Pradesh has been shut down temporarily by the Lower Dibang Valley district administration after serious allegations of sexual assault involving several young girls at the school’s hostel.

The decision comes as a response to growing concerns about the safety of students, and parents have been asked to take their wards out of the school and enrol them in nearby government or recognised private schools.

Authorities are taking this seriously. Superintendent of Police Ringu Ngupok said they’re planning tough action against the school’s management. For now, the school will shut down as investigations continue.

Curfew remains in force in Roing, though no further untoward incidents have been reported, the SP added.

The deceased was the former president of the Punpun BJP Kisan Morcha.

It’s the second case of the killing of a prominent BJP leader in the last 15 days. Earlier BJP leader Gopal Khemka, was killed outside his Patna residence on 4th July. His murder was caught on CCTV at his residence.

According to police officer Kanhaiya Singh, Kewat was shot by two men on a motorcycle in the Pipra police station area of Punpun block. They fled from the incident spot immediately.

“Surendra was working in the fields when unidentified men shot him dead. He was rushed to AIIMS, but he succumbed to his injuries during treatment,” Singh told reporters.

As the incident came to light, Phulwarisharif MLA, Gopal Ravidas, and former minister Shyam Rajak reached the hospital, where they met the grieving family and expressed condolences.

This murder has triggered a fresh political showdown in Bihar as the Leader of Opposition, Tejashwi Yadav, slammed the state government over the recent killings of officials in the state.

He shared a post on his X account targeting the state administration, saying, “And now, a BJP leader shot dead in Patna! What to say, and to whom? Is there anyone in the NDA government willing to listen to the truth or admit their mistakes?”

“Everyone knows about the CM’s health, but what are the two useless BJP deputy chief ministers doing?” he asked.

और अब पटना में बीजेपी नेता की गोली मारकर हत्या!



क्या कहे किससे कहे? NDA सरकार में कोई सच्चाई सुनने वाला नहीं, गलती स्वीकारने वाला नहीं?

In response, Union Minister and former Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi has accused the RJD of backing criminals to malign the state government.

In a statement issued to media, the group said that two senior leaders were killed in the missile strike.

ULFA-I also said that airstrikes on its camps in the area are still going on. It vowed revenge on Indian forces for the attack.

The statement said, “The occupying forces crossed all limits of humanity by launching a missile this time on funeral of Hon’ble President of the Lower Council of the United Liberation Forces of Assam [Independet], Lt. Gen. Nayan Asom, killed in the drone strike by the colonial forces. Brigadier Ganesh Asom and Colonel Pradeep Asom were killed and several other officers/members and civilians were injured in this brutal and inhuman attack by the mercenary forces. The occupying forces continue to carry out air strikes in certain areas. We would like to inform the indigenous people of Assam that; we are determined to take revenge on this barbaric attack by the colonial state.”

The statement has been sent to Ishan Asom, Associate Editor of the Communication Department of the banned outfit.

Notably, Indian Army launched a major surgical strike on militant camps in Myanmar on the early hours of Sunday. Over a hundred UAVs were reportedly used in the operation, which targeted camps of ULFA-I and other separatist groups of northeastern India. Four camps of ULFA-I, including the Eastern Command Headquarters (ECHQ) at Hoyat Basti and the 779 Camp located at Waktham Basti were reportedly targeted. Apart from killing Nayan Asom, the drone strike had injured several members of the outfit.

The strikes targeted camps in the Naga Self-Administered Zone near the India-Myanmar border. The operation was reportedly carried out in close coordination with the Myanmar military.

However, Indian defence forces have not confirmed any such operation till now.

The whole issue started over a minor argument between Sanjay Chaudhary, a Hindu resident, and his neighbour Rajesh Tiwari. Sanjay’s family used to throw leftover food for stray animals outside their house. Rajesh Tiwari objected to this, and an argument broke out.

Things took an ugly turn when Yasin Sheikh alias Sonu, a known history-sheeter in the area and Sanjay’s neighbour, got involved. He, along with his Muslim friends, attacked Rajesh Tiwari’s house and door with an axe multiple times. Eyewitnesses say that around 70-80 muslim men, armed with sticks, rods, and knives, stormed into Tiwari’s home and started beating him and his son’s friend brutally. The victims suffered serious injuries to their faces, legs, backs, and stomachs.

The attack didn’t stop at the hospital

Even after the police reached the spot and took the injured Tiwari family to the hospital, the attackers didn’t back off. They followed them to the hospital and beat them up again, this time right in front of the police.

FIR registered, some arrested

Rajesh Tiwari filed a police complaint after the attack. Based on CCTV footage and statements, the police arrested the main accused, Sanjay Chaudhary, Yasin Sheikh, and others, including Irfan Siddiqui, Anas Atif, and Rayaz Aggarwal. Attempted murder and rioting charges were filed. However, around a dozen more attackers are still absconding.

Communal tensions rise, Bajrang Dal protests

What started as a small fight soon turned into communal violence where the muslim mob attacked a Hindu family. After videos of the attack went viral, Bajrang Dal workers protested in front of the police station and Yasin’s house, demanding strict action. The area remains tense, with Yasin’s family reportedly admitting the mistake. However, they denied trying to give the matter a communal colour.

The organisation challenged the administration, saying the attack was communal and the delay in arresting others would not be tolerated.

He is a retired Foreign Service officer of the Indian Foreign Service of the 1984 batch. He was the Foreign Secretary of India from January 2020 to April 2022.

During his tenure, he handled big-ticket issues, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and thereafter served as Chief Coordinator for India’s G20 Presidency in 2023.

Over his long career, Shringla has served in significant positions. He has been India’s Ambassador to the US, Bangladesh, and Thailand.

During his time in Washington, he was instrumental in forging greater India-US ties and actively interacted with US lawmakers during delicate negotiations pertaining to Article 370 and the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

He is known for his calm nature and deep knowledge of global affairs. Many say he was one of the few Indian diplomats who could handle tough international situations with clarity and balance. During the pandemic, he helped lead the Ministry of External Affairs’ response and managed the massive Vande Bharat Mission that brought back lakhs of Indians from abroad.

Shringla was born in Mumbai and graduated from St. Stephen’s College, Delhi. He has, over time, earned a reputation for having a clear grasp of India’s foreign policy and for his diplomatic prowess.

His nomination to the Rajya Sabha is viewed as an appreciation of his decades of service to the nation and for his capability to make contributions to public policy and foreign relations even past retirement.

Jain has served as an Associate Professor of History in Gargi College at the University of Delhi. She has authored various books relating to Indian civilisation, religion and politics.

Her nomination to the Rajya Sabha is a significant step towards recognising scholarship having indigenous perspectives. In 2020, she was conferred the Padma Shri by the Government of India for her exceptional contribution to the field of history. Some of her textbooks have been included in the school curriculum.

Dr Jain is also a former member of the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library and the Governing Council of the Indian Council of Historical Research. Currently, Jain is a Senior Fellow of the Indian Council of Social Science Research. Her areas of research include cultural and religious developments in medieval and early modern India.

Dr Jain has done extensive research on various historical topics and has a vast body of work on issues relating to medieval and modern Indian history. Her historical works include, Flight of Deities and Rebirth of Temples (2019), The Battle for Rama: Case of the temple at Ayodhya (2017), Sati: Evangelicals, Baptist Missionaries and the changing Colonial Discourse (2016), Rama and Ayodhya (2013), Parallel Pathways: Essays on Hindu –Muslim Relations (1707-1857) (2010).

Jain’s works cover a wide range of topics in Indian history, including the practice of Sati, ancient temples, and India’s rich religious heritage, but her works on the Ayodhya Ram Temple stand out. Through her meticulously researched works, she presented a scholarly rebuttal to the established leftist narratives propagated by the likes of Romila Thapar and Irfan Habib, who distorted historical facts relating to the issues of national and civilizational importance like the Ram Temple in Ayodhya.

How Dr Jain exposed the left-narrative on the Ram Temple in Ayodhya

Dr Meenakshi Jain presented arguments founded on historical evidence in favour of the Ram Temple in her books on the Ayodhya dispute, Rama and Ayodhya (2013) and The Battle for Rama: Case of the Temple at Ayodhya (2017). Her books cleared the way for the Supreme Court judgment on the Ayodhya dispute in 2019, which held that a Ram Temple historically existed at the Janmabhoomi site. In her works on the Ram Temple, she also exposed how the so-called historians of the left distorted the truth and how the historical and government documents were tampered with after the British considered the site the birthplace of Lord Ram. According to Jain, all the literary evidence before 1989, when the left-historian hijacked the narrative about the Ram Temple, pointed to the fact that Babri Masjid was built on the site of a Hindu temple.

She said that a strong section of Muslims wanted the Ayodhya Ram Temple site to be handed over to the Hindus. But these left historians kept the dispute alive by convincing the Muslims that they had a strong case against the Ram Temple and promised to provide them with evidence for it.

Dr Jain’s latest book on the history of ‘Kashi’

In her latest book, “Vishwanath Rises and Rises” (2024), Jain writes about the history of one of the world’s oldest and holiest cities, Kashi. In the book, she gives an account of centuries of invasions and desecrations beginning from the early Islamic invasions till the destruction of the Kashi Vishwanath Mandir in 1669. She throws light on the unwavering commitment of Hindus, who made repeated attempts to rebuild their temples in Kashi, which were destroyed by the Muslim invaders. She cites, inter alia, the temple restoration efforts of Ahilyabai Holkar and the Marathas.",eminent historian dr meenakshi jain nominated president droupadi murmu rajya sabha saturday 12th july jain served associate professor history gargi college university delhi authored various book relating indian civilisation religion politics nomination rajya sabha significant step towards recognising scholarship indigenous perspective 2020 conferred padma shri government india exceptional contribution field history textbook included school curriculum dr jain also former member nehru memorial museum library governing council indian council historical research currently jain senior fellow indian council social science research area research include cultural religious development medieval early modern india dr jain done extensive research various historical topic vast body work issue relating medieval modern indian history historical work include flight deity rebirth temple 2019 battle rama case temple ayodhya 2017 sati evangelicals baptist missionary changing colonial discourse 2016 rama ayodhya 2013 parallel pathway essay hindu –muslim relation 1707 1857 2010 jain’s work cover wide range topic indian history including practice sati ancient temple india’s rich religious heritage work ayodhya ram temple stand meticulously researched work presented scholarly rebuttal established leftist narrative propagated like romila thapar irfan habib distorted historical fact relating issue national civilizational importance like ram temple ayodhya dr jain exposed left narrative ram temple ayodhya dr meenakshi jain presented argument founded historical evidence favour ram temple book ayodhya dispute rama ayodhya 2013 battle rama case temple ayodhya 2017 book cleared way supreme court judgment ayodhya dispute 2019 held ram temple historically existed janmabhoomi site work ram temple also exposed called historian left distorted truth historical government document tampered british considered site birthplace lord ram according jain literary evidence 1989 left historian hijacked narrative ram temple pointed fact babri masjid built site hindu temple said strong section muslim wanted ayodhya ram temple site handed hindu left historian kept dispute alive convincing muslim strong case ram temple promised provide evidence dr jain’s latest book history ‘kashi’ latest book “vishwanath rise rises” 2024 jain writes history one world’s oldest holiest city kashi book give account century invasion desecration beginning early islamic invasion till destruction kashi vishwanath mandir 1669 throw light unwavering commitment hindu made repeated attempt rebuild temple kashi destroyed muslim invader cite inter alia temple restoration effort ahilyabai holkar maratha

As per reports, India forces launched a series of drone strikes on the militant bases. ULFA-I said that it lost three senior leaders in the strike.

The strikes targeted camps in the Naga Self-Administered Zone near the India-Myanmar border. As per sources, over a hundred unmanned aerial vehicles were used in the surgical strikes. The operation was reportedly carried out in close coordination with the Myanmar military.

Some of the camps targeted by strike were ULFA-I’s Eastern Command Headquarters (ECHQ) at Hoyat Basti and the 779 Camp located at Waktham Basti. Two other camps of the outfit were also attacked in the operation. It is believed that ULFA-I’s top commander Nayan Medhi, alias Nayan Asom, may have been killed in the strike. He is considered a key strategist and military trainer of the banned outfit led by Paresh Baruah.

Similarly, some several NSCN-K camps were also hit in the drone attack.

ULFA-I confirmed the drone strikes in a press statement, saying that the attacks were carried out with drones in the early hours at several mobile camps. The outfit said that while one senior leader has been killed, around 19 others were injured.

The statement said that the strikes from 2 AM to 4 AM targeted the its camps along with nearby camps of RPF and PLA near the Nagaland-Myanmar border and Arunachal-Myanmar border. As per ULFA-I, drones made in Israel and France were used in the strike.

However, defence forces have not confirmed any such operation till now.

Notably, the outfit later claimed that while the last rites of Nayan Asom was going on, the camp was hit by a missile. The statement said that Brigadier Ganesh Asom and Colonel Pradip Asom were killed in the subsequent missile attack. ULFA-I said that airstrikes on its camps are still going on. The outfit vowed to take revenge for the strike.

The drone raid is a major operation by Indian forces on separatist groups in the north east after a long time. The region in Myanmar the Indian border has been used by the separatist groups in the region to set up camps for a long time. However, no major cross-border operation was carried out by India earlier.

C. Sadanandan, who is popularly known as Maash” (Master), is a teacher at a school in the Thrissur district of Kerala. His nomination to the Rajya Sabha is special, as it is not just a recognition of his contribution to public life and education but also to his personal struggles.

C. Sadanandan entered the national scene after surviving one of the most horrific political attacks in the tumultuous history of Kerala.

On the night of 25th January, 1994, at the age of 30, Sadanandan was ambushed by CPI(M) goons near his home village of Perinchery. In a shocking act of political violence, they chopped off both his legs and left him bleeding on the roadside as a warning to those switching political sides.

Recalling that night, he once shared how no one dared to help him because of fear. It was only when the police arrived on the scene, maybe fifteen minutes later, that I was whisked off to the hospital. By then, I had lost consciousness.

But that terrible night didn’t stop him from moving forward. He returned to teaching in 1999 and still works as a social science teacher at Sree Durga Vilasam Higher Secondary School in Peramangalam.

Over time, he also became an active part of the BJP and contested elections from the Koothuparambu constituency in 2016 and 2021.

A Story of Unbreakable Spirit: Sadanandan Master🗿🔥



For decades, BJP/RSS workers in Kerala have faced brutal attacks. Yet, there are fearless individuals in this small state who dedicate their lives to the nation, even at the risk of losing their own.



Meet Sadanandan Master,… pic.twitter.com/iRA4qapKxQ — महारथी-മഹാരഥി (@MahaRathii) February 5, 2025

In his youth, Sadanandan leaned towards communist ideas, just like many young people in Kerala. But things changed for him when he started reading more about the RSS and its views on cultural nationalism.

He was especially moved by poet Akkitham’s article ‘Bharata Darshanangal’ and joined the RSS in 1984, even though his family had strong Left roots. His father was a retired teacher and a CPI(M) supporter, and his brother was also an active party worker at the time.

Today, apart from teaching, Sadanandan is the state vice-president of the National Teachers Union in Kerala. He also edits its magazine Deshiya Adhyapaka Vartha and is part of the Bharatiya Vichara Kendram, an RSS-affiliated intellectual group.

He is married to his college love, Vanitha Rani, who is also a teacher, and their daughter Yamuna Bharati is studying BTech and is active in the ABVP student organisation.

OpIndia,12/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/air-india-plane-crash-report-what-are-aircraft-fuel-switches-how-they-operate/,Cuttoff at takeoff: Did a Boeing system malfunction doom Air India flight AI171? Read the critical role of engine fuel switches and what the...,"Weeks after the tragic crash of Air India flight AI171 on June 12, which left 260 dead and scores injured, a key detail from the preliminary report released by the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB0 had triggered serious debate about the possible causes for the mishap. The report revealed that both engine fuel control switches transitioned from “RUN” to “CUTOFF” within seconds of takeoff, leaving the pilots helpless as both engines lost power almost simultaneously.

This moment of confusion was record by cockpit voice recorder, with one pilot asking another if he had flipped the fuel switch, to which the other emphatically responds, “I didn’t.” The revelation has raised alarm bells about the aircraft’s systems, particularly the functioning of the fuel switches, and whether a technical malfunction, rather than human error, was responsible for the gruesome tragedy.

Engine fuel control levers or fuel switches, as they are popularly referred to, are crucial part of a modern airliner’s engine management system. In connection with the AI171 crash, which included a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, each engine has a dedicated fuel switch located in the cockpit, typically on the center console.

What are fuel switches in an aircraft?

These switches regulate the flow of fuel from the aircraft’s tanks to its engines, which provides the sheer thrust needed to defy gravity and lift hundreds of tonnes of metal into the sky. In essence, the “RUN” mode allows for uninterrupted fuel flow, keeping the engine alive.

The “CUTOFF” mode, on the other hand, shuts off that supply completely, killing the engine midstream. It is a switch that’s only meant to be used during shutdown or under rare emergency conditions. The importance of this system and the risks associated with its sudden malfunction, cannot be overstated.

During key periods of flight, these switches play an important role. When the pilot start the aircraft on ground, they first bring engine rotation speed up to required levels and then flip the fuel switches to “RUN” to ignite the engines. During normal flight, including takeoff, the switches are kept in the “RUN” position at all times. Moving them to “CUTOFF” is only done during engine shutdowns, such as at the end of a flight or in case of emergencies like an engine fire.

According to the AAIB report, Flight AI171 had accelerated to around 180 knots and had just lifted off when both engine fuel control switches inexplicably moved to “CUTOFF.” This happened within a second of each other, causing both engines to lose power almost instantly. The cockpit voice recorder captured one pilot asking the other, “Why did you cut off?”, to which the other replied, “I didn’t.” One of the pilots then attempted to restart the engines by moving the switches back to “RUN.” While one engine showed brief signs of recovery, the other did not respond. The aircraft rapidly lost altitude and crashed into a densely populated area near the airport.

This exchange, along with the near-simultaneous shutdown of both engines, has raised significant questions. Could one or both of the pilots have made a mistake during takeoff? Or was there a technical malfunction in the aircraft systems that caused the switches to move automatically?

Though pilot error is always a likelihood, as it with any other instance involving humans, it is noteworthy to mention that the AAIB is yet to reach such a conclusion just yet. The report has instead avoided attributing blame, highlighting only what is currently known and stating that the probe is ongoing.

What has gone largely underreported by several international media outlets is the fact that Boeing aircraft, including the 787 series, have previously been the subject of technical advisories related to fuel control systems. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued warnings in the past about certain Boeing models being vulnerable to what is known as “fuel lock” or inadvertent fuel cut-off issues—caused not by human error, but by faults in wiring, electronic engine control modules, or cross-system glitches that could send a false signal to the fuel switches.

In this context, the AI171 incident bears a worrying resemblance. Two highly trained pilots, both having hundreds of hours of flying time, and experienced with the 787, expressed confusion when the fuel supply was cut off. The fact that both switches moved nearly simultaneously could point to a technical failure rather than a human one, especially since modern aircraft systems are supposed to have safeguards to prevent such dual-engine shutdowns during critical phases of flight.

Moreover, the aircraft’s Ram Air Turbine (RAT), a backup emergency power system, was deployed automatically, indicating a complete loss of electrical and engine power. This further suggests that the problem may have been systemic, rather than isolated to one part of the cockpit.

Fuel control switches, by design, are not meant to be easily or accidentally moved during takeoff. Their positions are deliberate and guarded to prevent unintended action. For both switches to be flipped to “CUTOFF” seconds after takeoff, while the aircraft was at full thrust, is an extraordinary and dangerous occurrence—one that deserves rigorous investigation, not media speculation.

FAA’s warning about “fuel lock” in Boeing aircraft

In light of all this, the rush by several Western media outlets to cast doubt on the pilots’ actions appears premature and potentially irresponsible, perhaps deliberately done to protect Boeing from suffering material and reputational loss over its aircraft’s technical malfunctioning to cause the crash. By focusing on the cockpit conversation and omitting the technical context, especially the FAA’s previous warnings about similar issues with Boeing jets, these reports risk distorting public perception and potentially shielding the aircraft manufacturer from scrutiny.

Until the AAIB concludes its full investigation, any narrative that places blame on the flight crew without definitive evidence is not just speculative, but deeply unfair to the deceased pilots and their families. In fact, it could be safely assumed that any attempt to fix the blame before full investigation is a bid to pass the buck on to the slain pilots to shield the American aviation giant, Boeing. But as in aviation, truth must come from data, not from propaganda exercise.",week tragic crash air india flight ai171 june 12 left 260 dead score injured key detail preliminary report released aircraft accident investigation bureau aaib0 triggered serious debate possible cause mishap report revealed engine fuel control switch transitioned “run” “cutoff” within second takeoff leaving pilot helpless engine lost power almost simultaneously moment confusion record cockpit voice recorder one pilot asking another flipped fuel switch emphatically responds “i didn’t ” revelation raised alarm bell aircraft’s system particularly functioning fuel switch whether technical malfunction rather human error responsible gruesome tragedy engine fuel control lever fuel switch popularly referred crucial part modern airliner’s engine management system connection ai171 crash included boeing 787 8 dreamliner engine dedicated fuel switch located cockpit typically center console fuel switch aircraft switch regulate flow fuel aircraft’s tank engine provides sheer thrust needed defy gravity lift hundred tonne metal sky essence “run” mode allows uninterrupted fuel flow keeping engine alive “cutoff” mode hand shuts supply completely killing engine midstream switch that’s meant used shutdown rare emergency condition importance system risk associated sudden malfunction cannot overstated key period flight switch play important role pilot start aircraft ground first bring engine rotation speed required level flip fuel switch “run” ignite engine normal flight including takeoff switch kept “run” position time moving “cutoff” done engine shutdown end flight case emergency like engine fire according aaib report flight ai171 accelerated around 180 knot lifted engine fuel control switch inexplicably moved “cutoff ” happened within second causing engine lose power almost instantly cockpit voice recorder captured one pilot asking “why cut ” replied “i didn’t ” one pilot attempted restart engine moving switch back “run ” one engine showed brief sign recovery respond aircraft rapidly lost altitude crashed densely populated area near airport exchange along near simultaneous shutdown engine raised significant question could one pilot made mistake takeoff technical malfunction aircraft system caused switch move automatically though pilot error always likelihood instance involving human noteworthy mention aaib yet reach conclusion yet report instead avoided attributing blame highlighting currently known stating probe ongoing gone largely underreported several international medium outlet fact boeing aircraft including 787 series previously subject technical advisory related fuel control system u federal aviation administration faa issued warning past certain boeing model vulnerable known “fuel lock” inadvertent fuel cut issues—caused human error fault wiring electronic engine control module cross system glitch could send false signal fuel switch context ai171 incident bear worrying resemblance two highly trained pilot hundred hour flying time experienced 787 expressed confusion fuel supply cut fact switch moved nearly simultaneously could point technical failure rather human one especially since modern aircraft system supposed safeguard prevent dual engine shutdown critical phase flight moreover aircraft’s ram air turbine rat backup emergency power system deployed automatically indicating complete loss electrical engine power suggests problem may systemic rather isolated one part cockpit fuel control switch design meant easily accidentally moved takeoff position deliberate guarded prevent unintended action switch flipped “cutoff” second takeoff aircraft full thrust extraordinary dangerous occurrence—one deserves rigorous investigation medium speculation faa’s warning “fuel lock” boeing aircraft light rush several western medium outlet cast doubt pilots’ action appears premature potentially irresponsible perhaps deliberately done protect boeing suffering material reputational loss aircraft’s technical malfunctioning cause crash focusing cockpit conversation omitting technical context especially faa’s previous warning similar issue boeing jet report risk distorting public perception potentially shielding aircraft manufacturer scrutiny aaib concludes full investigation narrative place blame flight crew without definitive evidence speculative deeply unfair deceased pilot family fact could safely assumed attempt fix blame full investigation bid pas buck slain pilot shield american aviation giant boeing aviation truth must come data propaganda exercise

Speaking to Aaj Tak, the victim said that Chhangur Baba tried to lure him to convert to Islam by offering him ₹5 lakh, and even promised to build his house and gift him a bike. When Sanchit rejected the offer and refused to convert to Islam, Chhangur Baba threatened to kill him. “I worked at his house for 6 months. After that, he threatened that my family and I would be killed if I did not convert to Islam. He offered me ₹5 lakh, promised to build a house for my family and gift me a bike. But I told him that I follow Sanatan Dharma and that I would remain in the religion I was born into,” Sanchit said.

Sanchit said that after he refused to convert, the contractors working at Chhangur Baba’s residence also fought with him. He added that Chhangur Baba did not pay his wages and asked him to return all the money paid to him for his services so far. Chhangur Baba’s associate, Naveen (Jamaluddin), also reportedly abused and threatened Sanchit. “I told him (Chhnagur Baba) that I will not renounce my Hindu religion. I will keep reciting Hanuman Chalisa for the rest of my life,” the victim said.

Chhangur Baba implicated Sanchit and his wife in fake criminal cases

Bullied by Chhangur Baba and his men, Sanchit approached the DIG at night to file a complaint, but nothing happened. He wandered from place to place seeking protection, but all in vain. Unable to get any help, a helpless Sanchit moved to Lucknow with his family to escape Chhangur Baba and his men. However, Sanchit’s problems did not end here.

According to Sanchit, Chhangur Baba got criminal cases filed against him and his wife to pressure them. Sanchit alleged that Chhangur Baba paid money to some people in his village to pick a fight with his wife, which resulted in his wife spending 24 days in jail. Sanchit said that he sold his land, borrowed money and exhausted all his savings to get her out on bail and fight the cases filed against them. A fake case of rape was filed against Sanchit as well. Two criminal cases are currently pending against him. Sanchit said that Chhangur Baba harassed many people who came to work at his place. He said that many girls were brought to Chhangur Baba’s place.

The details revealed by Sanchit indicate how Chhangur Baba is so ‘well-connected’ that he managed to operate his conversion racket and target innocent people right under the nose of the authorities. Investigations into his conversion racket exposed his links with the criminal syndicate of mafia Mukhat Ansari.

Details revealed in the investigation so far

Jalaluddin aka Chhangur Baba’s Islamic conversion racket was busted by the Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) of the UP Police, which nabbed him on 5th July. The ATS uncovered massive foreign funding, over 100 crores, flowing in from the Gulf countries. Around 40 bank accounts have been identified by the authorities in which the money was received. Chhangur Baba and his associates, Neetu and Naveen, used to make frequent visits to Gulf countries.

Jalaluddin had laid down an elaborate strategy to target and convert vulnerable Hindu women, wherein he paid Muslim men to lure and force them to convert to Islam. He had fixed incentives for converting Hindu women as per their caste. His conversion network was spread across various districts and had links in the UAE. Jamaluddin collected huge wealth through the racket. He bought luxury cars and proporties. His name had come up earlier in December 2022, in connection with a case of forced conversion. A Dalit Hindu family had accused Chhangur Baba and his associates Neetu and Naveen of forcing them to convert.

The incident occurred after a minor altercation, which turned into a violent one. Faizan Baig was with a Hindu female friend, and some reports have termed it a matter of love jihad.

According to reports, Shyam More, the victim, came to the Ambedkar park with two friends on 10th July. The accused, Faizan Baig, was also present in the park with his girlfriend, a Hindu girl. The three friends were sitting on a nearby bench, talking and laughing loudly. They were also looking at Faizan and the girl.

Faizan thought that they were talking about them, and therefore called Shyam. When Shyam came near him, an argument started between them. Reportedly, Shyam questioned Faizan why he was with a Hindu girl. He accused Faizan of trapping Hindu girls in love jihad. This led to an escalation of the conflict.

Allegedly, Faizan’s girlfriend first slapped Shyam after hearing the allegations, and within a moment Faizan pulled out a knife from his pocket and stabbed Shyam More. When the other two youths rushed to protect Shyam, they were also attacked by Faizan.

All three were rushed to the hospital, but Shyam died on Thursday night. The other two youths are in serious condition and are undergoing treatment.

A injured youth said that while they were walking in the park, they noticed Faizan sitting with his girlfriend in an intimate posture. Faizan thought the group are laughing at his female friend. This led to an exchange of words. Faizan was asked why he had brought her here. Shyam alleged he is indulging her in Love Jihad. This angered Faizan. During the argument, Faizan’s girlfriend slapped Shyam, after which Faizan allegedly pulled out a knife and stabbed him.

However, Faizan gave a different version of the story, claiming that it was Shyam who was carrying the knife and tried to use it to attack him. Faizan claimed that he snatched the knife from Shyam’s hand during the clash and then attacked him.

Police have initiated the probe and have arrested Faizan. Further investigations are underway. The girl’s role in the incident is also being probed, as she had attacked Shyam first. However, the police have denied the love jihad angle, saying that both Faizan and the Hindu girl are adults.

The incident occurred in the Mandirbazar area in the South 24 Parganas district of West Bengal. The accused is the son of one Mashruf Molla.

Following the incident, the locals filed a complaint with the Mandirbazar police.

In a tweet, BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari informed, “Their audacity and insolence have reached such a level that they face no hesitation in spreading derogatory posts about Hindu gods and goddesses on social media. They know well that Mamata Banerjee’s police will not take any strict action against them.”

He directed the DGP of West Bengal police to take strict action against Madhu Molla and ensure his immediate arrest. The BJP leader warned that he would visit Mandirbazar and hold protests if the police failed to act against the accused.

After social media upheaval about the matter, the West Bengal police swung into action and put out a tweet.

It remains unclear whether the perpetrator has been arrested. It may be noted that the West Bengal police carefully omitted the name of Madhu Molla in its tweet.

The police warned netizens against sharing the image posted by him. “In the same breath, we urge all to behave responsibly and not to fuel disharmony by sharing screenshots of the image,” it claimed.

Nevertheless, Behera remains in Balasore jail as he hasn’t yet complied with the bail conditions.

He was booked under Sections 120-B (criminal conspiracy), 121 (abetting the waging of war against the Government of India), 121-A (conspiracy for offence under 121) and 34 (acts done with common intention) of the Indian Penal Code, read with Sections 3 (penalty for spying), 4 (communications with foreign agents to be evidence of commission of certain offences) and 5 (wrongful communication, use, retention, or failure to protect official information) of the Official Secrets Act.

Behera approached the High Court for regular bail last year. His counsel argued that the investigating officer had failed to present any conclusive evidence directly linking him with the alleged leak of defence secrets.

As per the court order, Behera was ordered to furnish a bail bond of Rs 5 lakh with two solvent sureties and compliance with several conditions, including fortnightly attendance at the local police station for six months and a ban on leaving the trial court’s jurisdiction without permission.

Behera, who worked as a contractual AC operator at ITR, was arrested in September 2021. He was among several people accused of spying for a Pakistani handler after allegedly falling victim to a honey-trap. The case was first investigated by the Odisha Police and later handed over to the State Crime Branch. It is currently being heard in the 3rd Additional Sessions Court in Balasore.

The judge noted that while the charges are serious, the trial hasn’t moved forward, and other co-accused like Sachin Kumar Chhata and Tapas Ranjan Nayak have already been granted bail. He said that under Article 21 of the Constitution, a person cannot be kept in jail endlessly just because the case is serious.",orissa high court released bail basanta kumar behera one key accused high profile chandipur spy case involving leakage sensitive defence data integrated test range itr drdo balasore district bail order ordered justice gourishankar satapathy stated behera remained jail long enough without trial also abused interim bail provided past nevertheless behera remains balasore jail hasn’t yet complied bail condition booked section 120 b criminal conspiracy 121 abetting waging war government india 121 conspiracy offence 121 34 act done common intention indian penal code read section 3 penalty spying 4 communication foreign agent evidence commission certain offence 5 wrongful communication use retention failure protect official information official secret act behera approached high court regular bail last year counsel argued investigating officer failed present conclusive evidence directly linking alleged leak defence secret per court order behera ordered furnish bail bond r 5 lakh two solvent surety compliance several condition including fortnightly attendance local police station six month ban leaving trial court’s jurisdiction without permission behera worked contractual ac operator itr arrested september 2021 among several people accused spying pakistani handler allegedly falling victim honey trap case first investigated odisha police later handed state crime branch currently heard 3rd additional session court balasore judge noted charge serious trial hasn’t moved forward co accused like sachin kumar chhata tapa ranjan nayak already granted bail said article 21 constitution person cannot kept jail endlessly case serious

The party has appealed to the youth of 360 villages of Delhi rural to reach the Maha Panchayat of Anangpur Sangharsh Samiti in maximum numbers.

Addressing a press conference on 11th July, AAP leader Saurabh Bharadwaj said, “To protect our village, we appeal to the youth from all 360 villages of Delhi, especially the younger generation, to join us on 13th July at the Mahapanchayat in Anangpur.

Faridabad Aravalis, illegal encroachments and politics

Anangpur is a historic village in Faridabad and comes under the Aravali forest region. This region is protected under the Punjab Land Preservation Act (PLPA) of 1990. This restricts non-forest activities in reserve forest land across 10 districts, including Haryana’s Faridabad.

In July 2022, the Supreme Court stated that Aravali land protected under PLPA (special orders) should be treated as forest, with provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, and any illegal structures should be demolished. This was followed by a 2013 National Green Tribunal (NGT) order banning non-forest activities in the protected forest land.

Subsequently, over 5,000 notices warning of demolition were served to property owners across Faridabad as part of the intensified crackdown on illegal structures

In December 2023, the Haryana government undertook a ground-truthing exercise and identified 6793 illegal structures across four villages in Faridabad: 5,948 in Anangpur, 339 in Ankhir, 313 in Lakkarpur, and 193 in Mewla Maharajpur. These illegal structures include houses, farmhouses, and banquet halls constructed on protected forest land.

Notably, reports say that the Forest Department has cleared encroachments at 85 of the 730 protected forest areas in Faridabad’s Aravali region.

In Anangpur, several villagers are opposed to the encroachment clearance drive, citing the village’s historical significance. It is said that this village was founded by Anangpal Tomar over 1,300 years ago. On 3rd July, three people were arrested in Anangpur for attacking a demolition team and police. The arrested trio were booked for obstructing government work.

In an attempt to exploit the local fury over the demolition drive in Anangpur and nearby 12 villages, the Aam Aadmi Party has lent support to the upcoming Mahapanchayat and is also instigating people against action on illegal encroachments.

So far, over 200 illegal structures have been reported to have been razed in Anangpur, while around 6000 are marked for removal. The Forest Department is also reviewing records in Lakkarpur to continue the anti-encroachment drive.

In Anangpur, the demolition drive has been ongoing for about 20 days, and the Forest Department, in collaboration with the Municipal Corporation, has demolished about 80 big farm houses so far.

Meanwhile, the Union Minister of State Krishan Pal Gurjar has assured the affected locals that none of the legitimate houses will be demolished. However, the residents of Anangpur remain concerned.

The anti-encroachment drive is being undertaken on the orders of the Supreme Court, and the Forest Department has to submit the report of the action to the Supreme Court by the end of July. Yet, the Aam Aadmi Party is politicising the court-ordered action for its own gains. By inciting Delhi youth to head to Faridabad to protest against a court-ordered action, the Aam Aadmi Party is trying to derail the encroachment clearance drive simply expand its appeal beyond Delhi by positioning itself as the ‘defender’ of the distressed communities in Haryana ahead of the 2026 assembly elections.",largely irrelevant losing power new delhi aam aadmi party resorted instigating people government’s action illegal encroachment aam aadmi party extended support maha panchayat held 13th july 2025 demolition drive anangpur haryana’s faridabad party appealed youth 360 village delhi rural reach maha panchayat anangpur sangharsh samiti maximum number addressing press conference 11th july aap leader saurabh bharadwaj said “to protect village appeal youth 360 village delhi especially younger generation join u 13th july mahapanchayat anangpur together plan united strategy resist government’s action ” said aap leader saurabh bharadwaj addressing press conference video delhi protect village appeal youth 360 village delhi especially younger generation join u 13th july mahapanchayat anangpur together plan united strategy resist government action said aap… pic twitter com oatgwvowdd — press trust india pti news july 11 2025 aap leader alleged government already acquired land question government trying forcibly snatch whatever little land left villager aap leader said party oppose delegation aam aadmi party also participate maha panchayat also called upon worker aap reach anangpur faridabad aravalis illegal encroachment politics anangpur historic village faridabad come aravali forest region region protected punjab land preservation act plpa 1990 restricts non forest activity reserve forest land across 10 district including haryana’s faridabad july 2022 supreme court stated aravali land protected plpa special order treated forest provision forest conservation act illegal structure demolished followed 2013 national green tribunal ngt order banning non forest activity protected forest land subsequently 5 000 notice warning demolition served property owner across faridabad part intensified crackdown illegal structure december 2023 haryana government undertook ground truthing exercise identified 6793 illegal structure across four village faridabad 5 948 anangpur 339 ankhir 313 lakkarpur 193 mewla maharajpur illegal structure include house farmhouse banquet hall constructed protected forest land notably report say forest department cleared encroachment 85 730 protected forest area faridabad’s aravali region anangpur several villager opposed encroachment clearance drive citing village’s historical significance said village founded anangpal tomar 1 300 year ago 3rd july three people arrested anangpur attacking demolition team police arrested trio booked obstructing government work attempt exploit local fury demolition drive anangpur nearby 12 village aam aadmi party lent support upcoming mahapanchayat also instigating people action illegal encroachment far 200 illegal structure reported razed anangpur around 6000 marked removal forest department also reviewing record lakkarpur continue anti encroachment drive anangpur demolition drive ongoing 20 day forest department collaboration municipal corporation demolished 80 big farm house far meanwhile union minister state krishan pal gurjar assured affected local none legitimate house demolished however resident anangpur remain concerned anti encroachment drive undertaken order supreme court forest department submit report action supreme court end july yet aam aadmi party politicising court ordered action gain inciting delhi youth head faridabad protest court ordered action aam aadmi party trying derail encroachment clearance drive simply expand appeal beyond delhi positioning ‘defender’ distressed community haryana ahead 2026 assembly election
OpIndia,11/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/ajit-doval-open-challenge-to-show-proof-of-damage-to-indian-assets-debunks-pakistani-propaganda/,"Ajit Doval challenges anyone to show a single proof of damage to Indian assets during Operation Sindoor, calls out Pakistani propaganda","The dramatic escalation between India and Pakistan following the April 2025 Pahalgam terror attack culminated in Operation Sindoor. This precision military response has since become a case study in modern information warfare. National Security Advisor Ajit Doval‘s recent challenge at IIT Madras cuts to the heart of this battle: “Show me one photo of Indian damage, even a glass being broken”. This statement isn’t mere rhetoric; it exposes a calculated Pakistani disinformation campaign built on fabricated victories and recycled imagery.

The core of Doval’s challenge

Doval revealed that Operation Sindoor hit precisely nine targets deep inside Pakistan. This included terror hubs in Bahawalpur (JeM) and Muridke (LeT). The entire operation took just 23 minutes. Satellite images later confirmed the damage. India achieved its objectives with zero collateral damage.

The mission showcased India’s indigenous capability. It relied completely on homegrown technology. This covered navigation, targeting, and execution. It marked a strategic shift for India. The move was from border skirmishes to deep-territory counterterrorism.

Doval also said that foreign media’s reports were contradicted by evidence. He specifically mentioned outlets like The New York Times. These outlets had amplified Pakistan’s claim of “retaliation“. However, they could not produce any visual proof of damage in India. Instead, their own satellite images accidentally confirmed India’s story. The images validated India’s precision strike claims.

Pakistan’s debunked claims: A pattern of fabrication

Pakistan’s military media (ISPR) and online supporters ran a coordinated campaign. They claimed two major victories. First, they alleged shooting down Indian fighter jets, including Rafales. They also said they captured pilots. Second, they claimed destroying Indian bases like Srinagar Airbase and an Army Brigade HQ.

But the reality was different. The story about downing jets, especially Rafales, was a hoax. A key viral image supposedly showing a downed Rafale was fake. It was actually from a September 2024 MiG-29 training crash in Rajasthan. The CEO of Rafale’s maker, Dassault Aviation, Eric Trappier, was clear. He stated: “What Pakistan is claiming about downing three Rafales is simply not true”.

The “evidence” presented online was also fake. Pro-Pakistan accounts shared misleading content. They used a video of the huge 2020 Beirut explosion and falsely claimed it showed retaliatory strikes on India. They passed off footage from the Battlefield 3 video game as real drone strikes. They even recycled an old clip of sectarian clashes inside Pakistan, pretending it showed the attack on Srinagar Airbase. None of it was real.

The Anatomy of a disinformation campaign

Pakistan’s ISPR-linked accounts rapidly pushed false narratives about Operation Sindoor. Some posts gained 3 million views in mere hours. Mainstream Pakistani media amplified these claims without verification. This tactic mirrors Pakistan’s response after the 2019 Balakot strikes. Back then, it denied losing an F-16, despite U.S. confirmation.

During Operation Sindoor, specific false claims emerged. One showed “Rafale wreckage,” but it was actually from a 2024 Indian MiG-29 crash. Another used a “Srinagar Airbase strike” video, which was really old footage from clashes in Pakistan. Pakistan also claimed “massive retaliation,” destroying 15 Indian locations. Yet, satellite images showed no damage. There was zero evidence supporting this claim.

Why this matters: The new frontlines of war

Doval’s challenge goes beyond military pride. It shows a key problem, information asymmetry. India shares openly, while Pakistan hides online. This digital deception hurts Pakistan’s global credibility. Meanwhile, India’s tech sovereignty made a difference. We have built our own systems. This meant real-time intelligence and precision strikes. India relied less on foreign tech. This matters globally.

Conclusion

Operation Sindoor underscores a paradigm shift, victory is no longer just territorial but narrative. Doval’s challenge—backed by satellite evidence and technological prowess—exposes Pakistan’s propaganda as a house of cards. For the international community, this is a wake-up call: in an era of deepfakes and synthetic media, verifying claims isn’t just journalistic duty—it’s a safeguard against escalation. As Doval asserted, “We missed none, and hit nowhere else”. In that precision lies India’s strategic edge—and Pakistan’s chronic credibility deficit.",dramatic escalation india pakistan following april 2025 pahalgam terror attack culminated operation sindoor precision military response since become case study modern information warfare national security advisor ajit doval‘s recent challenge iit madras cut heart battle “show one photo indian damage even glass broken” statement isn’t mere rhetoric expose calculated pakistani disinformation campaign built fabricated victory recycled imagery core doval’s challenge doval revealed operation sindoor hit precisely nine target deep inside pakistan included terror hub bahawalpur jem muridke let entire operation took 23 minute satellite image later confirmed damage india achieved objective zero collateral damage mission showcased india’s indigenous capability relied completely homegrown technology covered navigation targeting execution marked strategic shift india move border skirmish deep territory counterterrorism doval also said foreign media’s report contradicted evidence specifically mentioned outlet like new york time outlet amplified pakistan’s claim “retaliation“ however could produce visual proof damage india instead satellite image accidentally confirmed india’s story image validated india’s precision strike claim watch chennai tamil nadu speaking operation sindoor iit madras nsa ajit doval slam foreign medium reportage operation foreign press said pakistan this…you tell one photograph one image show damage any… pic twitter com v13pr8rurf — ani ani july 11 2025 pakistan’s debunked claim pattern fabrication pakistan’s military medium ispr online supporter ran coordinated campaign claimed two major victory first alleged shooting indian fighter jet including rafales also said captured pilot second claimed destroying indian base like srinagar airbase army brigade hq reality different story downing jet especially rafales hoax key viral image supposedly showing downed rafale fake actually september 2024 mig 29 training crash rajasthan ceo rafale’s maker dassault aviation eric trappier clear stated “what pakistan claiming downing three rafales simply true” “evidence” presented online also fake pro pakistan account shared misleading content used video huge 2020 beirut explosion falsely claimed showed retaliatory strike india passed footage battlefield 3 video game real drone strike even recycled old clip sectarian clash inside pakistan pretending showed attack srinagar airbase none real anatomy disinformation campaign pakistan’s ispr linked account rapidly pushed false narrative operation sindoor post gained 3 million view mere hour mainstream pakistani medium amplified claim without verification tactic mirror pakistan’s response 2019 balakot strike back denied losing f 16 despite u confirmation operation sindoor specific false claim emerged one showed “rafale wreckage ” actually 2024 indian mig 29 crash another used “srinagar airbase strike” video really old footage clash pakistan pakistan also claimed “massive retaliation ” destroying 15 indian location yet satellite image showed damage zero evidence supporting claim matter new frontlines war doval’s challenge go beyond military pride show key problem information asymmetry india share openly pakistan hide online digital deception hurt pakistan’s global credibility meanwhile india’s tech sovereignty made difference built system meant real time intelligence precision strike india relied less foreign tech matter globally conclusion operation sindoor underscore paradigm shift victory longer territorial narrative doval’s challenge—backed satellite evidence technological prowess—exposes pakistan’s propaganda house card international community wake call era deepfakes synthetic medium verifying claim isn’t journalistic duty—it’s safeguard escalation doval asserted “we missed none hit nowhere else” precision lie india’s strategic edge—and pakistan’s chronic credibility deficit
OpIndia,11/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/jaisalmer-muslim-mob-attacs-hindu-villagers-to-stop-re-construction-of-historic-cenotaphs/,"Jaisalmer: Violent Muslim mob including women and kids launches attack on Hindu villagers to stop re-construction of historic cenotaphs, cops injured in stone pelting","On 10th July, members of the Muslim community pelted stones at police personnel and Hindus constructing cenotaphs (chhatris) in Basanpir hamlet of Jaisalmer, in protest of the reconstruction undertaken to honour Ramchandra Sodha and Hadud Paliwal, near a pond. Women and children were positioned at the front of the mob to throw stones. The videos also show schoolgirls participating in the assault.

The Chhatris were built by the then Maharawal Gaj Singh in 1835 in Basanpir village, and are a symbol of historical and cultural heritage. However, they were demolished by some people in 2019. Therefore, the villagers have decided to rebuilt the monuments, and started work in 2021. But the work was stopped in just two days due to communal conflict. The re-construction started this year, but faced violent resistance from Muslims this time.

The police managed to control the unruly crowd using mild force and apprehended over three dozen perpetrators involved in the incident, including sixteen women. Eight cops, a tehsildar and at least two civilians were hurt in the surprise attack. They were brought to the district hospital for medical attention. Subsequently, the administration and authorities arrived at the scene while a significant number of Bharatiya Janata Party and Sangh Parivar members also gathered at the location.

Police and administration officials reached at the spot with heavy force, upon receiving information about the violence. During the instance, Ganpat Singh Nodiyala from the Junjhar Sangharsh Samiti and others sustained wound. “The administration was present but stood by silently. The other community used women and children as shields for stone-pelting,” he charged.

Meanwhile, a stampede ensued as the police began to apprehend the stone pelters. A cop was also injured amidst this chaos. According to the police, a case has been filed and emergency reinforcements were sent out. Senior administration officials, such as the Sub-Divisional Magistrate (SDM )and tehsildar, were in charge of maintaining law and order while additional forces were dispatched to Basanpir to prevent future flare-ups.

The authorities also asked residents to avoid sharing offensive or controversial posts on social media that would escalate tensions. They also warned that nobody will be permitted to interfere with law and order.

Jaisalmer MLA and BJP leaders Chhotu Singh Bhati condemned the violence and stated, “The historical chhatris built in memory of the brave warriors of the princely era, Ramchandra Sodha and Hadud Paliwal, have been a symbol of our glorious history, sacrifice and cultural heritage. Unfortunately, they were demolished by antisocial elements in 2019.”

He added, “Now, when their reconstruction work started, some people with radical thinking attempted to obstruct the construction. Not only was an attempt made to stop the work by stone-pelting, but many people were injured in the attack. This act is condemnable, cowardly and hurts social harmony.”

He further mentioned that in a sensitive place like Jaisalmer, which is close to the nation’s borders, such acts are quite concerning. “We are taking this seriously not only from the law and order perspective but also from the point of view of national security. No harm will be allowed to come to our valour, history, and culture. We are all committed to protecting the identity of Jaisalmer,” the lawmaker declared.

The violence revived a long-running conflict that began in 2019 when similar elements destroyed the historic chhatris erected in commemoration of Hadud Paliwal and Jujhar Ramchandra Singh Sodha, warriors from Jaisalmer’s princely era. They were heroes of 1828 war fought between the princely states of Jaisalmer and Bikaner at Basanpir.

The reconstruction was recently permitted after consistent submissions by the Hindu community, through mediation by local police and elders, but the development triggered the extremists. The barrage of stones also damaged some cars and even broke their glasses.

Many people arrived at the location following the occurrence. They insisted on carrying on with the construction and work was resumed after 6 hours.

In her complaint, she shared that Multani raped her after giving her a job.

According to the victim, she had been going through financial difficulties around a year ago and she was looking for a job to make ends meet. That’s when Altaf Multani offered her a job. She accepted his offer.

However, one day, Multani took her to his under-construction office and raped her there. The victim said that when she resisted Multani, he threatened to fire her from the job and kill her children. Thereafter, Multani raped the victim on multiple occasions using the same threats. He took her to different places in Ujjain, Indore and Ghosala on the pretext of work and raped her.

The victim said that she had filed a complaint regarding the same earlier, but the accused pressured her and got a settlement done. She said that Multani forced her to convert to Islam and marry him.

The ECI reported that approximately 18 lakh enrolled voters have died, 26 lakh have shifted, and 7 lakh names are duplicates.

The ECI revealed that nearly 97.30% of Bihar’s total 7.89 crore voters have completed the enumeration forms till now. That is more than 7.68 crore voters have already replied.

Officers such as the Chief Electoral Officer (CEO), District Election Officers (DEOs), Electoral Registration Officers (EROs), and Booth Level Officers (BLOs) are coordinating with political party workers to sanitize the voters’ list. The ECI has also published a list of 21.36 lakh voters whose forms are yet to be submitted, and approximately 52.30 lakh names of individuals who are deceased, have migrated permanently, or are listed in more than one location.

The ECI further stated that the BLOs and EROs are providing detailed lists of such voters to all political parties so that the process remains transparent. The people will be allowed a complete one-month period in order to object to or make corrections on names being added or removed from the voter list.

Opposition raises concerns

But the Opposition is strongly criticising this exercise. Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has charged the NDA alliance with attempting to delete names of people from the voter roll. She complained that voter rolls were inflated in Maharashtra elections, and now, voters are being deleted in Bihar in the guise of revision.

She stated, “Earlier, in Maharashtra, votes were tampered with by padding electoral rolls. Now, in Bihar, efforts are being made to do the same by deleting voters’ names. The ‘vote ban’ under the pretext of SIR is a plot to grab the right to vote given by the Constitution. We oppose every attempt to crush the Constitution.”

SIR exercise in Bihar

The Special Intensive Revision (SIR) is being conducted in Bihar to revise the voters’ lists for the upcoming assembly elections in the state. This kind of intensive revision occurred in the state for the last time in 2003. Due to changes such as urban migration, fatalities, new young voters, and the problem of illegal immigrants, a new verification became necessary.

OpIndia,11/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/1-29-lakh-bigha-land-occupied-by-bangladeshi-infiltrators-and-doubtful-citizens-freed-in-4-years-informs-assam-cm-himanta-biswa-sarma/,"1.29 lakh bigha land occupied by Bangladeshi infiltrators and doubtful citizens freed in 4 years, informs Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma","Chief Minister of Assam, Himanta Biswa Sarma stated that around 29 lakh bighas (nearly 10 lakh acres) of land in Assam is reported to be occupied by “Bangladeshi infiltrators and doubtful citizens.” He mentioned that after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government took office in 2021, a campaign was initiated to reclaim the property but they encountered international pressure to cease these actions.

He made the shocking disclosures on 21st July during a function commemorating the fourth anniversary of the Multipurpose Agricultural Project at Garukhuti in the Darang district.

This project commenced in 2021, and to date, 77,420 bighas of land (25,500 acres) have been cleared of encroachments.

“Today, the land in Garukhuti, once occupied illegally, has been converted into productive agricultural fields. This is the model we aim to replicate across encroached areas in Assam,” he conveyed.

In the last 4 years, we have freed over 42,000 acres of land from encroachers and dedicated it to public use. pic.twitter.com/AaWDKMcNTK — Himanta Biswa Sarma (@himantabiswa) July 21, 2025

According to media reports, Sarma remarked, “After the successful execution of the campaign in the Darang district, the initiative was also extended to Borsola, Lumding, Burhapahar, Pabha, Batadrava, Chapar and Paikan. In the last four years, we have reclaimed 1.29 lakh bigha (around 43,000 acres) of occupied land. A considerable portion of it is now being allocated for forest development and the citizens of the state.”

He declared, “If anyone believes that after two or three campaigns we will be intimidated, not confront them directly and bow down, they are mistaken. The martyrs of the Assam Movement will certainly be avenged.” He mentioned that during the Assam Movement from 1983 to 1985, there was a prevailing sense of defeat and many individuals had “surrendered” to the Congress which changed the political trajectory of the state.

Shankar-Madhav became Shankar-Azan

Sarma pointed out that, at a certain point, we started referring to Shankar-Madhav as Shankar-Azan. Azan Peer will continue to maintain his pivotal role, yet Madhav (Madhavdev) also has his own significant position. It is only then that our “caste” can be preserved. Srimanta Sankardev and Sri Sri Madhavdev are esteemed Vaishnav saints in Assam whereas Azan Peer was a Muslim sage who arrived there from Iraq during the 17th century.

Over 1000 bighas of land cleared in Goalpara

The Himanta government is actively involved in measures to safeguard the state’s demographic composition. As part of the drive, encroached lands have been reclaimed in various locations. On 12th July, an eviction operation took place in the Paikan Reserve Forest located in the Goalpara district. 140 hectares (equivalent to 1038 to 1040 bighas) of forest land had been unlawfully taken over predominantly by Muslims.

Tejas Mariswamy, the Divisional Forest Officer of Goalpara outlined that 1,080 families had built houses in this area. The majority of these individuals were Muslims who had migrated from adjacent regions or Bangladesh. A total of 36 bulldozers were utilized during the action and the region was divided into 6 distinct blocks. Nearly 2,500 to 2,700 structures, including houses and shops were dismantled. Over 1,000 police officers and forest guards were deployed for security purposes.

Mamata Banerjee cries “atrocities on Bengalis”

A war of words broke out on social media between Sarma and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee over the removal of infiltrators and illegal occupation in Assam. She complained that the administration is persecuting the Bengali community in Assam by singling them out, labeling it as the BJP’s divisive agenda.

However, Sarma responded that it is not the Bengalis but rather Muslim infiltrators who are being expelled from Assam. He also referenced a statement from the Supreme Court which characterized infiltration as an external invasion.",chief minister assam himanta biswa sarma stated around 29 lakh bighas nearly 10 lakh acre land assam reported occupied “bangladeshi infiltrator doubtful citizen ” mentioned bharatiya janata party bjp government took office 2021 campaign initiated reclaim property encountered international pressure cease action made shocking disclosure 21st july function commemorating fourth anniversary multipurpose agricultural project garukhuti darang district project commenced 2021 date 77 420 bighas land 25 500 acre cleared encroachment “today land garukhuti occupied illegally converted productive agricultural field model aim replicate across encroached area assam ” conveyed last 4 year freed 42 000 acre land encroacher dedicated public use pic twitter com aawdkmcntk — himanta biswa sarma himantabiswa july 21 2025 according medium report sarma remarked “after successful execution campaign darang district initiative also extended borsola lumding burhapahar pabha batadrava chapar paikan last four year reclaimed 1 29 lakh bigha around 43 000 acre occupied land considerable portion allocated forest development citizen state ” declared “if anyone belief two three campaign intimidated confront directly bow mistaken martyr assam movement certainly avenged ” mentioned assam movement 1983 1985 prevailing sense defeat many individual “surrendered” congress changed political trajectory state shankar madhav became shankar azan sarma pointed certain point started referring shankar madhav shankar azan azan peer continue maintain pivotal role yet madhav madhavdev also significant position “caste” preserved srimanta sankardev sri sri madhavdev esteemed vaishnav saint assam whereas azan peer muslim sage arrived iraq 17th century 1000 bighas land cleared goalpara himanta government actively involved measure safeguard state’s demographic composition part drive encroached land reclaimed various location 12th july eviction operation took place paikan reserve forest located goalpara district 140 hectare equivalent 1038 1040 bighas forest land unlawfully taken predominantly muslim tejas mariswamy divisional forest officer goalpara outlined 1 080 family built house area majority individual muslim migrated adjacent region bangladesh total 36 bulldozer utilized action region divided 6 distinct block nearly 2 500 2 700 structure including house shop dismantled 1 000 police officer forest guard deployed security purpose mamata banerjee cry “atrocities bengalis” war word broke social medium sarma west bengal chief minister mamata banerjee removal infiltrator illegal occupation assam complained administration persecuting bengali community assam singling labeling bjp’s divisive agenda however sarma responded bengali rather muslim infiltrator expelled assam also referenced statement supreme court characterized infiltration external invasion

The resignation came on the opening day of the Monsoon Session of Parliament, catching many by surprise amid a busy legislative agenda. Speculations are rife about the timing of Dhankhar’s resignation, with the opposition claiming that the reasons behind his stepping down may be far deeper than just health reasons.

In his letter to President Droupadi Murmu, Jagdeep Dhankhar invoked Article 67(a) of the Constitution to make his resignation effective immediately. Citing ongoing health challenges, he stated his intention to “prioritise health care and abide by medical advice.”

From the very onset in 2022, Dhankhar’s tenure as Vice President was marked by his vocal criticism of the judiciary, especially on the issues of its overreach and accountability. Being a seasoned lawyer himself and having a background in the Supreme Court and the Rajasthan High Court, Jagdeep Dhankhar consistently raised concerns over the alleged encroachment of the powers of the legislature and executive by the judiciary, arguing that their actions undermined the supremacy of Parliament and the balance of powers as prescribed in the Constitution.

“Judiciary cannot become executive”: When Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar warned the judiciary that its overreach might destabilise governance

Hitting back at the judiciary regarding the overturning of parliamentary amendments to the Constitution in December 2022, VP Jagdeep Dhankhar warned that the judiciary cannot become the legislative or the executive because doing so may destabilise the system of government as a whole.

Dhankhar stated during the eighth LM Singhvi memorial lecture that our judiciary, as one of the important institutions of government, cannot be the executive or legislative.

“The doctrine of separation of power is fundamental to our governance. Any incursion, howsoever subtle, in the domain of the other by one has the capacity or potential to unsettle the apple cart of governance,” then vice president stated.

“India in 2015-16 was dealing with a constitutional amendment act and as a matter of record the entire Lok Sabha voted unanimously and there was no abstention in Lok Sabha and that amendment act was passed. In Rajya Sabha, there was no opposition. We the people their ordainment came to be reflected through the most sanctified mechanisms through the applicable mechanisms. That power was undone. The world does not know of any such instance. I appeal to all judicial minds please think of a parallel in the world where a constitutional provision can be undone,” the vice president stated.

In the presence of then Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud, several Supreme Court judges, Union Ministers, then Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and several lawyers, Dhankhar further said, “Power resides in ‘We the People’ – their mandate, their wisdom… If a constitutional provision that carries the ordainment of the people at large in such a vibrant democracy is undone, what will happen? I appeal to the people here, they constitute a judicial elite class, thinking minds, intellectuals – please find out a parallel in the world where a constitutional provision can be undone.”

He also asserted that while the Indian Constitution clearly states in Article 145(3) that the court may interpret the Constitution where a serious question of law is involved. “Nowhere it say a provision can be run down.”

When VP Jagdeep Dhankhar came down heavily on the Supreme Court for scrapping the NJAC

Back in December 2022, Dhankhar criticised the Supreme Court over the 99th Constitutional Amendment Bill paving way for the National Judicial Appointment Commission (NJAC), which was undone by the Supreme Court in 2015.

“The Parliament in a much-needed historic step passed the 99th Constitutional Amendment Bill, paving the way for the National Judicial Appointment Commission (NJAC). There was unprecedented support for the above. On August 13, 2014, the Lok Sabha unanimously voted in its favour with there being no abstentions. This House too, passed it unanimously on August 14, 2014, with one abstention. Rarely in Parliamentary democracy, there has been such massive support to a Constitutional legislation,” Dhankhar said.

“This process fructified into a Constitutional prescription, after 16 State Assemblies out of 29 States ratified the Central Legislation; the President of India, in terms of Article 111, accorded his consent on December 31, 2014,” he added.

Furthermore, then Vice President, Jagdeep Dhankhar stated that this was the first time that a duly legitimised constitutional prescription was judicially undone, “This historic parliamentary mandate was undone by the Supreme Court on October 16, 2015 by a majority of 4:1 finding the same as not being in consonance with the judicially evolved doctrine of ‘Basic Structure’ of the Constitution,” said.

Dhankhar had called the scrapping of the NJAC a severe compromise of parliamentary sovereignty and disregard of the mandate of the people, of which this house and the Lok Sabha are custodians.

VP Dhankhar had also emphasised that Parliament is the exclusive and ultimate determinative of the architecture of the Constitution.

“We need to bear in mind that in democratic governance, the basis of any ‘Basic Structure’ is the prevalence of primacy of the mandate of the people reflected in the Parliament. Parliament is the exclusive and ultimate determinative of the architecture of the Constitution,” said.

It must be recalled that back in 2014, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government brought the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) Act in an attempt to change the system of appointment of judges. The NJAC was a proposed body, which would have been responsible for the appointment and transfer of judges to the higher judiciary. The NJAC Act and the Constitutional Amendment Act came into force on April 13, 2015. But the top court on October 16, 2015, struck down the NJAC Act. The verdict brought back the primacy of the collegium system of judges appointing judges.

VP Jagdeep Dhankhar differed from Supreme Court’s idea of ‘basic structure’ doctrine

In January 2023, Dhankhar once again reignited the discussion over the doctrine of the separation of powers. This time, he cited the Supreme Court’s landmark judgment in the 1973 Kesavanand Bharati case wherein the court had ruled that while Parliament had the authority to amend the Constitution, it cannot amend its basic structure.

Delivering his inaugural address at the 83rd All-India Presiding Officers Conference in Jaipur, Jagdeep Dhankhar questioned: “Are we a democratic nation?”

Asserting that all three pillars of democracy: legislature, executive and judiciary must function within their limits, then Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar said, “In a democratic society, the basis of any basic structure is supremacy of the people, sovereignty of the people, sovereignty of Parliament. Executive thrives on the sovereignty of Parliament. Legislatures and Parliament decide who will be the Chief Minister, who will be the Prime Minister. The ultimate power is with the Legislature. The Legislature decides who will be in other institutions. In such a situation, all Constitutional institutions – the Legislative, Executive, Judiciary – are required to be within their limits.”

Expressing his disagreement over the Supreme Court ruling in the Kesavanand Bharati case that the Parliament cannot amend the constitution’s basic structure, Dhankhar said, “In 1973, in the Kesavananda Bharati case, the Supreme Court gave the idea of basic structure, saying that Parliament can amend the Constitution, but not its basic structure. With due respect to the Judiciary, I cannot subscribe to this.”

‘Time has come to revisit’: When Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar questioned the involvement of the CJI in executive appointments

In February 2025, Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar questioned how the judiciary can be involved in executive appointments as the Supreme Court of India was hearing a petition seeking to include the Chief Justice of India in the selection committee for the Election Commission. He said while earlier the executive yielded to the inclusion of judges in executive functions, it was time to revisit the norms.

Speaking at the National Judicial Academy, Bhopal, Dhankhar said that such a system should not exist in a democracy like India. He wondered how the Chief Justice of India participates in the selection of the CBI director, even by “statutory prescription”.

The vice president said, “To stir your minds, how can in a country like ours or in any democracy, by statutory prescription, the Chief Justice of India participate in the selection of the CBI director! Can there be any legal rationale for it? I can appreciate that the statutory prescription took shape because the Executive of the day has yielded to a judicial verdict. But time has come to revisit.”

Jagdeep Dhankhar further said, “This surely does not merge with democracy. How can we involve the Chief Justice of India in any executive appointment?”

Dhankhar went on to say that while the Supreme Court has the power to interpret the constitution, there can be no “arrogation of authority” under the guise of interpretation. The essence and spirit which the founding fathers had in mind under Article 145(3) must be respected.”

He further advocated for an increase in the constitutional bench strength, as originally the constitution bench comprised the majority of total judges.

“When the strength of the Supreme Court was eight judges, under Article 145(3), there was a stipulation that interpretation of the Constitution would be by a bench of five judges or more. Please note, when this strength was eight, it was five. And the Constitution allows the highest court of the land to interpret the Constitution. If I analyse arithmetically, they were very sure the interpretation will be by the majority of judges, because the strength then was eight. That five stands as it is. And the number (of total judges) is more than fourfold,” he said.

VP Dhankhar’s advocacy for including domain experts in arbitral process instead of retired judges

In March 2025, Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar said that the arbitral process in India is “just an additional burden to the normal hierarchical mechanism of adjudication.”

Addressing the Colloquium organised by the India International Arbitration Centre (IIAC) at Bharat Mandapam, Dhankhar said, “Arbitrators play as much critical role as members of the bar associated with the arbiter process. Surprisingly, there is, I’m saying it with utmost restraint, absolute tight-fist control of a segment of a category that is involved with arbiter process determination. This tight-fist control emanates out of judicial feats. And if we examine it on an objective platform, it is excruciatingly painful.”

Emphasising the significance of Article 136 and its effects on the arbitration process, Dhankhar said that while Article 136 was supposed to be a narrow slit, it is hurting the arbitral process.

“The Attorney General of the country can really reflect and make a big change. Which country in the world, Attorney, tell me, has suo moto cognisance by the highest court? I’m sure I can’t look around. And Article 136 intervention was supposed to be a narrow-slit. The wall has been demolished with anything and everything under the sun, including what a magistrate has to do, what a Session Judge has to do, what a District Judge has to do, and what a High Court Judge has to do. That wall demolition is also hurting the arbitral process. All I am suggesting, in all humility and as a concerned citizen of this country, is that the issue you are debating is critical to micro and small industries. They want a facile, easy arbitral process”.

Jagdeep Dhankhar condemned Supreme Court’s “judicial overreach”, calling it an unelected ‘super Parliament’

In April 2025, VP Jagdeep Dhankhar harshly criticised the recent Supreme Court verdict regarding the powers of the Governor and the President under Articles 200 and 201 of the Constitution. In the Judgment passed on 8th April 2025, a division bench of the Supreme Court set a time limit, not envisaged in the Constitution, on the exercise of power to grant or refuse assent to a state Bill by the President and the Governor. The Supreme Court prescribed a deadline of 3 months on the President’s power to grant or refuse assent to a Bill reserved by the Governor for his consideration.

Without mincing words, VP Dhankhar questioned the Supreme Court for issuing a direction to the President of India. He reminded the Supreme Court that its power is limited to interpreting the Constitution. “We cannot have a situation where you direct the President of India, and on what basis? The only right you have under the Constitution is to interpret the Constitution under Article 145(3), ” said the Vice President in an address during the Valedictory Function of the 6th Rajya Sabha Internship Program at Vice-President’s Enclave on 17th April.

“The President is called upon to decide in a time-bound manner, and if not, it becomes law. So we have judges who will legislate, who will perform executive functions, who will act as super-parliament, and absolutely have no accountability because the law of the land does not apply to them,” he said.

Highlighting the fact that the judgment, which had the effect of modifying the concerned provisions, was delivered by a bench of two judges which did not represent the majority of the total number of judges in the Supreme Court.

“When Article 145(3) was there, the number of judges in the Supreme Court was eight, 5 out of 8, now 5 out of 30 and odd. But forget about it, the judges who issued a mandamus virtually to the President and presented a scenario that it will be the law of the land, have forgotten the power of the Constitution. How can that combination of judges deal with something under Article 145(3) if preserved, it was then for five out of eight. We need to make amends for that also now. Five out of eight would mean interpretation will be by majority. Well, five constitutes more than the majority in eight. But leave that aside. Article 142 has become a nuclear missile against Democratic forces, available to the judiciary 24 x 7,” Dhankhar said.

Notably, in the verdict passed in The State of Tamil Nadu v The Governor of Tamil Nadu and Anr, the Apex Court examined the ambit of powers of the President and the Governor conferred under Articles 200 and 201 of the Constitution. The Supreme Court held that the President should decide on the Bills sent to him by the Governor for consideration within 3 months, and that any delay beyond the prescribed time limit should be justified by recording reasons. Besides, the Court ruled that if the President fails to decide on a Bill within 3 months, then the State government can seek the issuance of the writ of mandamus from the Supreme Court against the President. The judgment has been widely criticised for alleged judicial overreach or a judicial attempt to effectively amend the constitution.

Dhankhar questioned the handling of the Justice Yashwant Varma case

Former Vice-President Dhankhar had also raised questions on how the Supreme Court handled the matter relating to the discovery of huge amounts of unaccounted cash at the house of Justice Yashwant Varma. “An event happened on the night of the 14th and 15th of March in New Delhi, at the residence of a judge. For seven days, no one knew about it. We have to ask questions to ourselves. Is the delay explainable? Condonable? Does it not raise certain fundamental questions? In any ordinary situation, and ordinary situations define the rule of law, things would have been different. It was only on 21st March, disclosed by a newspaper, that people of the country were shocked as never before, ” the Vice-President remarked.

“I support judicial independence — but ACCOUNTABILITY IS KEY.” pic.twitter.com/THpUDUe6aO — Megh Updates 🚨™ (@MeghUpdates) July 7, 2025

“Thereafter, fortunately, in the public domain, we had input from an authoritative source, the Supreme Court of India. And the input indicated culpability. Input did not lead to doubt that something was amiss. Something requires to be investigated. Now the nation waits with bated breath. The nation is restive because one of our institutions, to which people have always looked up with the highest respect and deference, was put in the dock,” he added.

Jagdeep Dhankhar: The man who questioned judicial overreach, sought accountability and advocated for balance of powers even in the face of backlash from the opposition and slandering by the leftist ecosystem

Dhankhar’s fierce critiques of what he deemed judicial overreach and encroachment of the powers of the legislature were not without pushback. Beyond the insulting mimicries, several opposition leaders labelled Dhankhar as ‘non-neutral’ and his comments slamming the judiciary ‘unconstitutional’. The opposition parties and the leftist media cabal even accused the former VP of ‘undermining’ judicial independence. Not to forget, the leftist propaganda portal The Wire went as far as to call Dhankhar a “partisan attack dog” over VP Dhankhar’s criticism of the Supreme Court for using Article 142 and calling it a “nuclear missile against democratic forces”.

Despite the slandering, mockery and criticism, Dhankhar did not shy away from raising concern over judicial overreach, particularly in matters involving a delicate balance of power among the judiciary, executive and legislature. Even in the judge Yaswant Varma case, Jagdeep Dhankhar publicly questioned the actions of the Supreme Court, raising concerns regarding accountability in a democracy wherein elected representatives are subject to scrutiny but judges are nearly immune to all sorts of accountability and scrutiny.

While the opposition and the leftist media ecosystem accused VP Dhankhar of delivering politically charged rhetoric at the behest of his ‘political masters’, the BJP, VP Dhankhar’s remarks were not politically charged or at odds with his constitutional duty, rather, his criticism of the judiciary was driven by a genuine concern over a pattern wherein the judiciary seems to be discharging the duties of President, and at times those of the Parliament as well.

Dhankhar’s courage, however, has not been surprising as even during his tenure as the governor of West Bengal, he repeatedly raised concern over post-poll violence in the state and severely criticised the TMC government for the Birbhum massacre. He remained at loggerheads with the CM Mamata Banerjee-led state government over issues pertaining to federalism and governance, condemning the near-collapse of democracy in the state.

While the opposition and its media cheerleaders mocked Jagdeep Dhankhar, belittled the importance of the Vice President’s post and projected the judiciary as somewhat sacrosanct to criticism, even moved a failed impeachment motion, Jagdeep Dhankhar stood his ground, not for personal gains, not for clout, not for political leverage, but for democracy, for constitution and the supremacy of the people’s mandate.

Several parliamentarians had earlier also raised concerns over judicial activism and overreach; however, Dhankhar’s interventions brought the debate to the forefront, triggering the judiciary, lawmakers and the public to ponder over the question of the judiciary’s role in a healthy democracy.

Jagdeep Dhankhar’s tenure as the Vice President of India and Rajya Sabha chairman will be remembered for many good reasons, especially his role as a defender of constitutional balance. He gave a fervent call for judicial accountability, critiqued judicial overreach while reiterating his belief in parliamentary supremacy. While the opposition parties gave him nothing but insults, mockery and hate, Dhankhar tried to accommodate opposition voices despite ideological differences. Dhankhar’s resignation marks the end of a chapter; however, the questions he raised about the judiciary’s role and accountability will continue to shape India’s constitutional discourse.",21st july

OpIndia,11/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/first-balasore-self-immolation-now-greater-noida-suicide-the-problem-of-harassment-of-students/,"First Balasore self-immolation, now Greater Noida suicide: Why do we need such tragedies to wake us up to the problem of harassment of students","Jyoti Sharma, a second-year student from Sharda University in Greater Noida, pursuing BDS, died by suicide in her hostel room. She passed away on July 18, Friday, reportedly after writing a suicide note. The note accuses two professors and the university administration of mental harassment. The two staff members, Mahinder and Shairy, have been arrested so far.

In the suicide letter, she wrote that she had been mentally harassed and humiliated for a long time, which caused her significant distress. She expressed her desire for the accused to face legal action. She held the teachers of PCP and Dental Materials responsible for her death.

The note reads, “They mentally harassed me. They humiliated me. I have been under stress because of them for a long time. I want them to face the same thing. I am sorry. I can’t live like this anymore. I can’t…”

Shortly after the incident came to light, students gathered and protested against the university administration, alleging negligence. They claimed Jyoti had been under immense stress due to accusations of forging signatures. A minor scuffle broke out between the protesters and the police, while the family of the deceased was seen manhandling the head of the dentistry department.

The incident occurred on Friday night, and a case has been filed at the Knowledge Park Police Station in Gautam Buddha Nagar. “The woman’s body has been sent for post-mortem, and two staff members of the university have been arrested on the basis of a complaint filed by the victim’s family,” said Additional DCP of Greater Noida, Sudhir Kumar.

He added that tension had escalated due to the anger among the deceased’s family and university students towards the administration. The anger and scuffle were defused by the police through dialogue, and peace was restored at the scene. Further legal proceedings are underway.

Dr. Ajit Kumar, the university’s Public Relations Officer, confirmed that two faculty members have been suspended. “For now, two teachers have been suspended. A committee has also been formed to investigate the matter. Action will be taken against those found guilty based on the committee’s report,” he stated.

This is not an isolated case of a student taking her life due to harassment. A similar incident took place in Odisha’s Balasore shocking self-immolation case on July 12. A 20-year-old girl set herself on fire, allegedly after enduring sexual harassment by the head of her college department. She suffered 90 percent burns and later succumbed to her injuries at AIIMS Bhubaneswar on July 14.

These brutal incidents show no discrimination based on gender or age. This was evident in the tragic case of a teenager from The Global Public School in Kerala who ended his life after reportedly being bullied, assaulted, and harassed by his schoolmates.

According to the teenager’s mother, on January 15, he was forcibly taken to the toilet and made to lick the seat; his head was then pushed into the toilet while it was flushed. He was also bullied for his skin tone. The relentless harassment severely affected his mental health, ultimately driving him to end his life by jumping from the 26th floor of their apartment building.

On April 30, 2023, a 16-year-old boy died by suicide after allegedly being mentally abused by his principal and faculty members. He purportedly left a suicide note in which he apologized to his parents and elder brothers and urged serious action against those who had harassed him. The boy allegedly died by suicide in Telangana, with his family accusing the college management and certain members of the teaching staff of harassment and holding them responsible for his death, police reported. The student, in his first year of intermediate studies at a private college in Narsingi, Telangana, was found hanging in a classroom by his friends on Tuesday night, April 30.

All these incidents reflect one painful similarity: before taking their own lives, the victims tried to express what they were going through and, in the end, wrote in their suicide notes. Instead of receiving empathy and support from those around them when they spoke up about harassment in educational institutions, their voices were often ignored. Their stories must be heard, and their grievances must be addressed before blaming the victim. Continued ignorance will only lead to more such tragedies unless educational institutions actively work towards providing safe, empathetic, and responsive environments for students.",jyoti sharma second year student sharda university greater noida pursuing bd died suicide hostel room passed away july 18 friday reportedly writing suicide note note accuses two professor university administration mental harassment two staff member mahinder shairy arrested far suicide letter wrote mentally harassed humiliated long time caused significant distress expressed desire accused face legal action held teacher pcp dental material responsible death note read “they mentally harassed humiliated stress long time want face thing sorry can’t live like anymore can’t…” shortly incident came light student gathered protested university administration alleging negligence claimed jyoti immense stress due accusation forging signature minor scuffle broke protester police family deceased seen manhandling head dentistry department incident occurred friday night case filed knowledge park police station gautam buddha nagar “the woman’s body sent post mortem two staff member university arrested basis complaint filed victim’s family ” said additional dcp greater noida sudhir kumar added tension escalated due anger among deceased’s family university student towards administration anger scuffle defused police dialogue peace restored scene legal proceeding underway dr ajit kumar university’s public relation officer confirmed two faculty member suspended “for two teacher suspended committee also formed investigate matter action taken found guilty based committee’s report ” stated isolated case student taking life due harassment similar incident took place odisha’s balasore shocking self immolation case july 12 20 year old girl set fire allegedly enduring sexual harassment head college department suffered 90 percent burn later succumbed injury aiims bhubaneswar july 14 brutal incident show discrimination based gender age evident tragic case teenager global public school kerala ended life reportedly bullied assaulted harassed schoolmate according teenager’s mother january 15 forcibly taken toilet made lick seat head pushed toilet flushed also bullied skin tone relentless harassment severely affected mental health ultimately driving end life jumping 26th floor apartment building april 30 2023 16 year old boy died suicide allegedly mentally abused principal faculty member purportedly left suicide note apologized parent elder brother urged serious action harassed boy allegedly died suicide telangana family accusing college management certain member teaching staff harassment holding responsible death police reported student first year intermediate study private college narsingi telangana found hanging classroom friend tuesday night april 30 incident reflect one painful similarity taking life victim tried express going end wrote suicide note instead receiving empathy support around spoke harassment educational institution voice often ignored story must heard grievance must addressed blaming victim continued ignorance lead tragedy unless educational institution actively work towards providing safe empathetic responsive environment student
OpIndia,11/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/truck-still-stuck-collapsed-gambhira-bridge-gujarat-as-media-blames-officials-know-what-happened/,"Truck still stuck on collapsed Gambhira bridge in Gujarat: As media blames officials, Anand district collector shares the real reason with OpIndia","After a part of the Gambhira Bridge connecting Saurashtra region and Central Gujarat collapsed on the morning of 9th July, 2025, a truck which got stuck on the bridge is still hanging there, fifteen days after the incident.

Some media reports based on the interviews of the truck driver and the owner claimed that the officials of the two districts of Anand and Vadodara are denying their accountability, which is causing unnecessary hardships to the truck driver and the owner, who have been running from pillar to post to get the truck removed. Pending EMIs are adding to the worries of the truck driver, who is not even able to claim the insurance.

A report in Divya Bhaskar quoted truck owner Ramashankar Pal as saying, ” The officials of the Anand government office are putting the responsibility on Vadodara, and the officials of Vadodara are putting the responsibility on Anand. We are tired of facing all the hassles. The officials replied that the army was also requested to remove the truck by helicopter, but there is no possibility of the truck being removed right now.”

The truck owner further told Bhaskar, “I have a loan on the truck and I have to pay an instalment of Rs 1 lakh every month. If the truck runs, I will be able to pay the instalment. The administration had given me an assurance for removing the truck, but even after so many days, I have not been able to get the truck.”

The title of the Divya Bhaskar report reads- ‘First the truck was hanging, now the officials are ‘hanging’ it: Even after 10 days of the accident, the truck is still on the Gambhira bridge, the driver is wandering to unload the truck, saying – there is an instalment of lakhs per month.’

A Gujarati News’ TV channel, GSTV wrote, ‘The government has raised its hands’, the situation of the truck owner is difficult, and no one is listening to him. It has also been claimed in this report that the truck owner has been doing the rounds of the government offices of Anand-Vadodara for ten days, but he did not get any response. “We have to pay the instalments for the truck. The bank is saying that we have to pay the instalments, while the insurance company is saying that the truck is safe, no insurance will be given,” said the truck owner as quoted by GSTV.

Anand District Collector spoke to OpIndia

When OpIndia contacted Anand District Collector Praveen Chaudhary regarding the entire matter, a different version came to light. He said that there is no dispute between the two districts, and neither is the delay due to the administration blaming each other. The reality is that the truck could not be removed due to some technical reasons that emerged during the rescue operation that lasted for several days. However, the Anand District Collectorate is providing all possible help to the truck owner.

Divulging the details about the entire incident, the Anand District Collector said, “After the bridge accident, it was impossible to take heavy machinery like cranes on the bridge due to technical reasons. The truck will need to be lifted from the front, which was damaged, using a crane. But the Road and Building Department believed that using a crane in such a situation is dangerous.” He said that the rescue operation has been going on continuously, and machines were deployed till yesterday. Now that the rescue operation is almost complete, a team from the mechanical wing of the Road and Building Construction Department is working on it in collaboration with a private company and experts from High Speed Railway Corporation Limited.

“Whether the truck should be pulled back or lifted by providing some support from below is being contemplated. It also has to be seen that there is no danger to any human life in this,” the District Collector said.

The truck was not removed, as a rescue operation was going on

The reason for the delay in removing the truck is that the rescue operation went on for several days after the accident. A tanker was not found, so a sonar machine was brought from Mumbai to search and locate it underwater. When the NDRF started the rescue operation after the incident, the district administration was requested to keep the stranded truck tied so that it would not pose any danger to the rescue efforts going on under the bridge, as the rescue operation was a priority at that time.

After discussing with the NDRF team, the district administration tied the truck to a crane from the back to ensure that the rescue operation went on unaffected. When the Army was consulted, it said that pushing or pulling the truck would require the involvement of people and would put their lives in danger. At present, technical teams of the Road and Building Department are working on the strategy to remove the truck ,and it will be disposed of soon. Teams from both the district administrations are also assisting in the operation.

The collector also clarified the issue of insurance and EMI

The Anand District Collector said that the truck owner visited his office and met him and the additional district magistrate, who explained everything to him. The owner agreed for the truck to be destroyed, but it has to be done in such a way that does not put any life in danger. The plan to do this is being worked out.

As far as insurance is concerned, the District Collector said that he met the insurance company. The company said that if the government gave a written certificate of the incident, they would approve the insurance claim. The collector’s office has also given assurance in this regard, and the written process will be completed with the company.

Regarding EMI, the collector said that although this is a matter between the bank and the truck owner, the administration cannot directly interfere in it, yet he wrote a letter to the bank and requested it to postpone the instalment for two to three months on humanitarian grounds. Also, a representation will be sent to the State Level Bankers Committee, so that the truck owner can get relief on EMI.

The District Collector made it clear that this is not an Anand-Vadodara issue. The area where this incident happened and the truck got stuck is entirely in Vadodara, but since the Vadodara administration was continuously engaged in the rescue operation, the Anand district administration stepped in and provided all possible assistance.",part gambhira bridge connecting saurashtra region central gujarat collapsed morning 9th july 2025 truck got stuck bridge still hanging fifteen day incident medium report based interview truck driver owner claimed official two district anand vadodara denying accountability causing unnecessary hardship truck driver owner running pillar post get truck removed pending emis adding worry truck driver even able claim insurance truck hanging broken gambhira bridge image via x theskindoctor13 report divya bhaskar quoted truck owner ramashankar pal saying ” official anand government office putting responsibility vadodara official vadodara putting responsibility anand tired facing hassle official replied army also requested remove truck helicopter possibility truck removed right ” truck owner told bhaskar “i loan truck pay instalment r 1 lakh every month truck run able pay instalment administration given assurance removing truck even many day able get truck ” title divya bhaskar report read ‘first truck hanging official ‘hanging’ even 10 day accident truck still gambhira bridge driver wandering unload truck saying – instalment lakh per month ’ gujarati news’ tv channel gstv wrote ‘the government raised hands’ situation truck owner difficult one listening also claimed report truck owner round government office anand vadodara ten day get response “we pay instalment truck bank saying pay instalment insurance company saying truck safe insurance given ” said truck owner quoted gstv anand district collector spoke opindia opindia contacted anand district collector praveen chaudhary regarding entire matter different version came light said dispute two district neither delay due administration blaming reality truck could removed due technical reason emerged rescue operation lasted several day however anand district collectorate providing possible help truck owner divulging detail entire incident anand district collector said “after bridge accident impossible take heavy machinery like crane bridge due technical reason truck need lifted front damaged using crane road building department believed using crane situation dangerous ” said rescue operation going continuously machine deployed till yesterday rescue operation almost complete team mechanical wing road building construction department working collaboration private company expert high speed railway corporation limited “whether truck pulled back lifted providing support contemplated also seen danger human life ” district collector said truck removed rescue operation going reason delay removing truck rescue operation went several day accident tanker found sonar machine brought mumbai search locate underwater ndrf started rescue operation incident district administration requested keep stranded truck tied would pose danger rescue effort going bridge rescue operation priority time discussing ndrf team district administration tied truck crane back ensure rescue operation went unaffected army consulted said pushing pulling truck would require involvement people would put life danger present technical team road building department working strategy remove truck disposed soon team district administration also assisting operation collector also clarified issue insurance emi anand district collector said truck owner visited office met additional district magistrate explained everything owner agreed truck destroyed done way put life danger plan worked far insurance concerned district collector said met insurance company company said government gave written certificate incident would approve insurance claim collector’s office also given assurance regard written process completed company regarding emi collector said although matter bank truck owner administration cannot directly interfere yet wrote letter bank requested postpone instalment two three month humanitarian ground also representation sent state level banker committee truck owner get relief emi district collector made clear anand vadodara issue area incident happened truck got stuck entirely vadodara since vadodara administration continuously engaged rescue operation anand district administration stepped provided possible assistance
OpIndia,11/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/pib-fake-news-samosa-jalebi-health-warning-cigarettes-media-news/,Fake claim: PIB calls out false media reports that union health ministry is set to issue health warning for samosa and jalebi like they...,"Many Indian media outlets, including Times of India and NDTV, recently published a news story alleging that popular Indian snacks and sweets such as samosa, jalebi and laddoo will be served alongside a health warning akin to those on cigarette packets. Furthermore, the new development was attributed to the Union Ministry of Health that it has been done in order to tackle health issues.

On 15th July, PIB fact-check, however, refuted the claims as false. It emphasized that the ministry’s advisory does not include any warning labels on food items sold by vendors and “has not been selective towards Indian snacks.”

Additionally, it clarified that the general recommendation is not unique to any one food product but rather serves as a “behavioural nudge” to alert consumers to “hidden fats and excess sugar in all food products.”

✅The general advisory is a behavioural nudge to make people aware of hidden fats and excess sugar in all food products, and not specifically to any particular food product.



The advisory is for healthier options and initiatives at workplaces and urges people to make healthier… pic.twitter.com/gD3f2XOeTF — PIB Fact Check (@PIBFactCheck) July 15, 2025

The agency added that the suggestion encourages “people to make healthier” decisions to reduce unnecessary sugar and oil in favour of a healthy diet and way of life as well as supports healthier workplace options and activities. “It does not target India’s rich street food culture,” it further pointed out.

What is in the letter

The ministry’s official letter identified “sharp rise in obesity in both children and adults” as a significant concern. It informed, “As per NFHS-5 (2019-21), over one in five adults in urban areas are overweight or obese. Prevalence of childhood obesity is impacted by poor dietary habits and reduced physical activity.”

It added, “As per The Lancet GBD 2021 obesity forecasting study, published in 2025, the number of overweight and obese adults in India is projected to rise from 18 crores in 2021 to 44.9 crores by 2050, making it the country with the second-highest global burden.” It stated that obesity dramatically increases the risk of non-communicable diseases like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease and several types of cancer.

The ministry pointed out, “It also affects mental health, mobility, and quality of life, and imposes a heavy economic burden through increased healthcare costs and productivity losses. Early prevention and health promotion are critical to reversing these trends.”

The letter outlined that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made a strong case for changing people’s lifestyles in order to fight obesity. “At the Opening Ceremony of the 38th National Games in Dehradun on 28th January 2025, Hon’ble Prime Minister invoked the Fit India Campaign and urged citizens to adopt active, healthy lifestyles as part of the broader vision of a Swasth Bharat. In his Mann Ki Baat, he called for a 10% reduction in oil consumption,” the official communiqué read.

It then conveyed, “In response to this national appeal, and as part of the ministry’s flagship initiatives under the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases (NP-NCD), it is imperative to promote sustainable behavioural changes in our workplaces. These include reducing excessive consumption of oil and sugar, both of which are key contributors to rising rates of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and other lifestyle-related disorders.”

According to the letter, it is advocating that Sugar and Oil Boards be displayed as an effort to encourage better eating practices in multiple settings. They will function as visual behavioural cues in public spaces like offices and schools, revealing important details including hidden sugars and fats in common food items.

Hence, a direction to all “departments/offices/autonomous bodies and other public institutions/organizations” under the ministry was sought.

Quoting INCLEN International Executive Director and proposed lead analyst N.K.

It added that “this larger study will analyse the trend of such deaths in an attempt to determine the risk factors for such mortalities”.

However, the Print news article was fact-checked by the PIB, which termed the claims made in it as fake.

Claims linking sudden deaths to COVID vaccine

Several claims linking sudden deaths caused by heart attack to the COVID-19 vaccine have been spreading across social media for years. However, the central government debunked all these claims earlier this month, on the grounds of two extensive studies conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research(ICMR) and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences. The studies found that there was no direct link between sudden deaths by heart attack and the COVID-19 vaccines.

Besides, studies by the ICMR and National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) affirmed that COVID-19 vaccines in India are safe and effective, with extremely rare instances of serious side effects. Sudden deaths due to heart attacks can be linked to a wide range of factors, including genetics, lifestyle, pre-existing conditions, and post-COVID complications.

To understand the causes of sudden, unexplained deaths, especially in young adults between the ages of 18 and 45 years, the ICMR and the NCDC conducted a study across 47 tertiary care hospitals in 19 states and UTs. Another study conducted by AIIMS with ICMR funding also examined cases of sudden cardiac deaths and found genetic mutations, pre-existing conditions, and lifestyle as the primary causes of these deaths and no correlation with Covid-19 vaccination.",medium portal print recently seen spreading fake news purported study conducted central government analyse pattern “to assess pattern sudden deaths” india covid 19 pandemic print published news article july 8 2025 claimed health research department dhr union ministry health collaborating inclen international clinical epidemiology network international new delhi based health research organisation conduct national community level study examine rise death among people 45 year age screenshot news article published print quoting inclen international executive director proposed lead analyst n k arora print claimed “the new nationwide assessment aim document sudden death community level across states” added “this larger study analyse trend death attempt determine risk factor mortalities” however print news article fact checked pib termed claim made fake news report theprintindia claimed centre commissioned nationwide study assess pattern sudden death india pibfactcheck ❌ claim fake ✅ nationwide survey commissioned centre department health… pic twitter com gpsrc1hz1c — pib fact check pibfactcheck july 9 2025 pib posted x “in news report theprintindia claimed centre commissioned nationwide study assess pattern sudden death india nationwide survey commissioned centre depthealthres dhr ” claim linking sudden death covid vaccine several claim linking sudden death caused heart attack covid 19 vaccine spreading across social medium year however central government debunked claim earlier month ground two extensive study conducted indian council medical research icmr india institute medical science study found direct link sudden death heart attack covid 19 vaccine besides study icmr national centre disease control ncdc affirmed covid 19 vaccine india safe effective extremely rare instance serious side effect sudden death due heart attack linked wide range factor including genetics lifestyle pre existing condition post covid complication understand cause sudden unexplained death especially young adult age 18 45 year icmr ncdc conducted study across 47 tertiary care hospital 19 state ut another study conducted aiims icmr funding also examined case sudden cardiac death found genetic mutation pre existing condition lifestyle primary cause death correlation covid 19 vaccination

The book has a chapter titled “Reshaping India’s Political Map”, which covers Indian history between the 13th and the 17th century, including the rise and fall of the Delhi Sultanate and the resistance to it, the Vijayanagar Empire, the Mughal Empire, and the resistance faced by them, and the rise of the Sikhs.

At the beginning of the book comes is a note for students, which gives them a contextual understanding of the inclusion of some dark historical episodes like the Islamic fundamentalism in the book and the approach to be adopted while studying them. “History sometimes seems to be full of wars and destruction… Should we omit them entirely? … The best approach is to face them and analyse them so as to understand what made such developments possible and, hopefully, help avoid their recurrence in future. It is important to study those darker developments dispassionately, without blaming anyone living today for them… The past continues to live with us and shapes the present.”

To be introduced in schools from the 2025-26 academic year, the book attempts to provide a complete picture of historical events or periods included in it by retaining their negative as well as positive aspects. While the book mentions how Mughal rulers Jahangir and Shah Jahan patronised art and architecture, it also highlights the brutalities of Babur, who massacred the entire populations of cities. It describes Aurangzeb as a military ruler who banned un-Islamic practices and reimposed taxes on non-Muslims and defines the rule of Mughal ruler Akbar, the left-liberal coterie’s poster boy of the Mughal period, as a “blend of brutality and tolerance”.

But the left liberals, who are habitual of using history as a tool to further their agenda, have a problem with it. They have a problem because the facade built by leftist historians who downplayed and whitewashed the brutalities of Islamic invaders and justified their atrocities against Hindus is crumbling. For a long time, they pushed a false narrative by portraying Mughal King Akbar as the epitome of religious tolerance. They eulogised him for abolishing the Jizya tax, a religious tax levied by Muslim rulers on Hindus and other non-Muslims for merely existing in an Islamic regime, but cleverly omitted to mention how he waged Jihad against Hindus during the seige of Chittorgarh and ordered the massacre of 30,000 Hindus populace.

The seige of Chittoragarh

By 1567, Mughal ruler Akbar had managed to get most parts of northern India under his control. Now, he was eyeing the Kingdom of Mewar, which was being ruled by the Suryavanshi Sisodia Rajput dynasty at that time, under Rana Udai Singh II. The Mewar kingdom stood as a symbol of resistance against the Mughal Empire, which had subdued most of the surrounding kingdoms. Akbar decided to launch a military expedition to besiege the Mewar capital at Chittorgarh and termed it as ‘Jihad’ against the infidels (Hindus).

Chittorgarh, situated in present-day Rajasthan, was a formidable fort spanning across 700 acres, situated atop 180 a high hill in the heart of the Mewar Kingdom. The fortress had survived the sieges by Aluddin Khilji (1303) and Bahadur Shah of Gujarat (1535).

Refusing to bow down before the Mughal emperor, Rana Udai Singh II geared up to defend his kingdom. In October 1567, Akbar marched from Agra with his army of 40,000 men equipped with cannons, muskets and siege equipment, aiming to bring the Mewar Kingdom to its knees. Inside the Chittorgarh fort was an army of 8000 Rajput warriors prepared to defend their pride. On the advice of his counsels, Rana Udai Singh II moved to his principality in the Aravali hills and left the Rajput army under the command of Jaimal Rathore.

The Mughal army strategically set up their camp at the base of the Chittorgarh hill to cut off supplies to the fort. The siege began, and both armies soon engaged in a full-fledged battle with arrows, musket shots and cannon shots flying across the sky. The Mughal army was struggling to penetrate the 30-feet-thick walls of the Chittorgarh fort. The Mughal soldiers made several strategies to breach the mighty walls of the Chittorgarh fort. They tried to stealthily march towards the base of the fort through covered trenches and dig burrows under the foundation of the fort and pack gunpowder in them to blow up the fort’s base. However, the Rajput armies were watching them. They dug counter-mines and resisted the Mughal armies, which suffered heavy losses.

The battle went on for months, till the fateful day when the Rajput commander Jaimal Rathore fell. There are varied accounts of the cause of Jaimal Rathore’s death. Some accounts say that he died from a musket shot fired by Akbar on February 22, 1568. Other accounts mention that Rathore was killed by Mughal marksmen. Jaimal Rathore’s death was a turning point in the battle, as the Rajput armies were demoralised and the Mughal armies were able to breach the fort. As soon as the fort was breached by the Mughal armies, the Rajput women inside the fort performed jauhar to protect their honour from the enemy. The remaining Rajput soldiers put up a final resistance before the Mughal armies and laid down their lives, before the fort was finally captured on February 23-24, 1568.

Some Mughal sources say that the Rajput armies of about 8000-10,000 men were entirely killed. Mughal king Akbar, who was frustrated and enraged by the stiff resistance put up by the Rajput armies, proclaimed the siege of Chittorgarh and the victory of Islam over infidels and ordered the massacre of the entire civilian population of around 30,000 people. The men were killed, and several women and children were enslaved.

But, according to left-liberals, Mughal King Akbar was a liberal and tolerant ruler, who abolished the Jizya tax, and not a cruel, intolerant tyrant who ordered the slaughter of thousands of innocent, unarmed Hindu civilians of the Chittorgarh fort, who posed no harm to him. This special ability to see one truth by ignoring the other truth is peculiar to the left-liberals. The only acceptable truth to them is their version of truth, no matter how incomplete, selective or even untrue it is.

This unique quality of theirs begs the question, Jo cheez jaisi hai usey vaisa usey vaisa he pesh kyo na kiya jaye, taat ko resham kyo kaha jaye?

It has been revealed that humans lived in that are around 4,000 years ago. Scientists who were searching for additional information about the captivating location in the Raichur district made the discovery. A collaborative team of 20 researches from India, Canada and the United States worked together to learn more about the area’s past.

Researchers have been excavating around Mallikarjun Hill, close to the Mallikarjuna Temple and the town’s Anjaneya Swamy temple. They have come across a variety of artefacts and other tools that date back four millennia which suggests that the area was once a vibrant settlement.

Professor Dr Andrew M. Bauer of Stanford University in the United States, Dr. Peter G. Johansen of McGill University in Canada and Hemanth Kadambi of Shiv Nadar University in Delhi-NCR (National Capital Region) alongside their team of over 20 researchers have been seeking evidence of human habitation and civilisation in Maski for the past three months.

They approached Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) for approval and afterward the crew began exploring Maski. The scientists identified 271 places of interest in the area and began their work. They unearthed evidence that the area surrounding the temple and Mallikarjun Hill was occupied by people from the 11th to the 14th century BCE.

They located an array of antiquities, including cooking tools like earthen pots and pans. Kadambi declared, “We have found evidence that indicates that there was a human settlement in Maski around 4,000 years ago.”

Maski inscription

Notably, British gold mine engineer C. Beadon found the Maski inscription in 1915. The region made its place on the archaeological map when the inscription, which dates to the time of the Mauryan emperor Ashoka, came to light. It was etched onto a rock surface within a cave.

One of the earliest inscriptions from the Mauryan era, it prominently displays the emperor’s name and his title as “Devanampriya” (Beloved of the Gods). A long-standing disagreement about whether the legendary ruler was actually referred to by the title or not was resolved when the same was mentioned alongside his name. It was written in Brahmi script and in the Prakrit language, highlighting his adherence to non-violence.",remarkable archaeological finding drawn attention karnataka’s maski town revealed human lived around 4 000 year ago scientist searching additional information captivating location raichur district made discovery collaborative team 20 research india canada united state worked together learn area’s past researcher excavating around mallikarjun hill close mallikarjuna temple town’s anjaneya swamy temple come across variety artefact tool date back four millennium suggests area vibrant settlement professor dr andrew bauer stanford university united state dr peter g johansen mcgill university canada hemanth kadambi shiv nadar university delhi ncr national capital region alongside team 20 researcher seeking evidence human habitation civilisation maski past three month approached archaeological survey india asi approval afterward crew began exploring maski scientist identified 271 place interest area began work unearthed evidence area surrounding temple mallikarjun hill occupied people 11th 14th century bce located array antiquity including cooking tool like earthen pot pan kadambi declared “we found evidence indicates human settlement maski around 4 000 year ago ” maski inscription notably british gold mine engineer c beadon found maski inscription 1915 region made place archaeological map inscription date time mauryan emperor ashoka came light etched onto rock surface within cave one earliest inscription mauryan era prominently display emperor’s name title “devanampriya” beloved god long standing disagreement whether legendary ruler actually referred title resolved mentioned alongside name written brahmi script prakrit language highlighting adherence non violence

While the attack itself was disturbing, what sparked further indignation was how Irish mainstream media chose to report the incident.

Instead of unequivocally condemning the brutality, reports used language that cast doubt on the nature of the crime, referring to it as an “alleged assault” despite the visible and horrific injuries sustained by the victim. This minimisation of violence, which bore all the hallmarks of a racially motivated hate crime, was called out in strong terms by the Indian Ambassador to Ireland, Akhilesh Mishra.

Ambassador Akhilesh Mishra exposes media bias over assault against an Indian origin man

Ambassador Mishra’s comments came with images of news reports that chose to cast doubt over the victim’s trauma, a strategy not unfamiliar to those tracking media narratives targeting Hindus globally. In doing so, Mishra highlighted an uncomfortable truth: that certain Western media institutions would rather gaslight Indian victims than confront the racial or ideological motivations behind such hate crimes.

The incident: A false accusation, brutal assault, and media whitewashing

The Indian man, who had arrived in Ireland just three weeks earlier, was assaulted and partially stripped in public in Tallaght on Saturday evening, July 19. According to The Irish Times, a mob confronted the man and falsely accused him of acting inappropriately around children, claims that were later disseminated online as part of a digital witch-hunt.

Irish police (Gardaí) have since confirmed that no evidence exists to support the accusations, yet the man was violently attacked, left bleeding, and taken to Tallaght University Hospital with serious injuries. Gardaí are now investigating the case as a possible hate crime, and there is speculation that the attack was racially motivated.

Local councillor Baby Pereppadan (Fine Gael) visited the victim and said he remains in shock and is not taking visitors. “Small incidents like these are happening frequently in Tallaght,” he warned, urging stronger police deployment in the area.

Sinn Féin TD Seán Crowe condemned the mob action as “vile and utterly unacceptable.” “Anyone who thinks this sort of mindless, racist violence makes their community safer is lying and fooling no one. This is not the first such attack in our area but it has to be the last,” he said.

A pattern of dehumanisation: Global racism targeting Hindus

While people of colour, especially Africans and South-East Asians, have long faced discrimination in the West, the treatment meted out to Indians, and Hindus in particular, reveals a unique and consistent pattern of prejudice. Hindus are not just exoticised or mocked; they are systematically demonised, dehumanised, and often blamed for the crimes of their persecutors.

Nowhere is this more apparent than in the disturbing trends on social media platforms where Hindu identity, symbols, and customs are routinely mocked with impunity.

From derogatory “cow piss” jibes to offensive caricatures of Hindu deities, the Hinduphobia is not just a cultural issue; it is a civilisational struggle where polytheistic traditions and Sanatan values are targeted by both far-left ideologues and right-wing supremacists, particularly in the West.

One need only look at the case of Stew Peters, a self-styled “America First” commentator who in 2024 described Hindus as “dot-headed cockroaches,” falsely alleging that Indians smear cow dung on their faces. Or Laura Loomer, who launched a xenophobic tirade against Indian-American Sriram Krishnan following his appointment to a senior AI policy position at the White House, calling Indians “third-world invaders.”

The vitriol extended far beyond individuals. Hindu deities like Maa Kali and Lord Ganesha were called “supervillains,” “demonic,” and “unfit for a first-world Christian country.” These sentiments are not just isolated outbursts but part of a coordinated campaign to otherise and vilify the Hindu community, especially those living proudly and unapologetically in the diaspora.

And this bigotry is undergirded by latent racism against Indians, particularly Hindus, and it rises to the surface every now and then, in both physical and psychological form —from attacking them literally as witnessed in Dublin to more sophisticated forms of assault — Hindumisic conferences organised in western universities that serve to legitimise such racism and give way to its more dangerous siblings, bigotry and dehumanisation.

The “Dismantling Global Hindutva” Conference: Institutionalised hatred of Hindus

Perhaps the most blatant example of institutionalised Hinduphobia came in the form of the “Dismantling Global Hindutva” conference held in September 2021. Sponsored by over 60 academic departments from 45+ universities, primarily in the United States, the three-day event brought together some of the most vocal and virulent anti-Hindu activists in academia and media.

The speakers list read like a who’s who of Hindumisia, including Audrey Truschke, Anand Patwardhan, Nandini Sundar, and Neha Dixit, individuals known for drawing false equivalences between Hindutva and Nazism. Ironically, the event’s poster depicted an inverted hammer violently uprooting a saffron-clad RSS Swayamsevak, a visual metaphor for the organised dismantling of Hindu civilisational identity.

The hammer, disguised as a pencil, was meant to portray “academic critique,” but its Nazi-esque symbolism mirrored the Röhm Putsch imagery of Nazi propaganda, where ‘eliminating violent elements’ was used to justify political murders. In this case, the target wasn’t a rogue militia. It was a symbolic attack on Hindus who dare to be assertive about their culture and beliefs.

The points of discussion during the conference followed a classic Goebbelsian propaganda template: select a few emotive triggers, repeat them endlessly, and cast your enemies as the threat to civilisation. It’s a strategy that paves the way for dehumanisation and, eventually, justifies violence.

The RSS or other Hindu organisations targeted aren’t paramilitary thugs. They are groups that aid flood victims, rescue women from trafficking, or assist during pandemics, tasks most self-proclaimed ‘liberal saviours’ wouldn’t touch. So why label them “militant”?

Because self-defence, cultural reclamation, and Hindu unity threaten the ideological monopoly of Islamists, Marxists, and global evangelists.

Research reveals a disturbing surge in Hinduphobic slurs and hate speech across social media platforms

A comprehensive 2023 study by the Network Contagion Research Institute (NCRI) lends credence to Mishra’s concerns. The report, ‘Quantitative Methods for Investigating Anti-Hindu Disinformation’, found a sharp rise in derogatory and genocidal content targeting Hindus across platforms like 4Chan, Telegram, Gab, and Twitter. These include memes and slurs such as “pajeet”, a racial epithet used to mock and dehumanise Hindus, alongside visual propaganda depicting Hindu symbols like tilaks and saffron clothing being subjected to ISIS-style beheadings or Nazi-style executions. The analysis also showed that the usage of such coded hate terms surged dramatically around key geopolitical events involving India, indicating coordinated disinformation efforts.

Perhaps most alarmingly, the NCRI discovered that Iranian state-sponsored troll networks were deeply involved in disseminating Hinduphobic content, often under fake Pakistani identities. These accounts strategically amplified hashtags and tropes accusing Hindus of genocide, inflaming caste divisions, and misrepresenting communal incidents like the 2020 Delhi riots. The trolls pretended to be human rights activists while tagging major news outlets like CNN and MSNBC to internationalise their narrative. This manipulation of digital platforms for geopolitical ends shows that Hinduphobia is not merely social bigotry; it is being weaponised as a tool of hybrid warfare.

The incident in Dublin, therefore, is not just a case of individual victimisation, it is a symptom of a transnational campaign to dehumanise Hindus in both physical and ideological realms. The assault, followed by media whitewashing, echoes the same patterns identified in the NCRI report: digital dehumanisation leading to real-world violence. Mishra’s remarks, then, are not only a defence of one man’s dignity but a broader call to recognise and confront the systemic erasure of Hindu identity under the guise of liberal tolerance.

From Anti-CAA protests to Digital pogroms

The dehumanisation of Hindus gained major momentum during the anti-CAA protests in India. Posters morphed the sacred Om into Nazi swastikas, women wearing bindis were portrayed as oppressors, and slogans like “Hinduon se Azadi” (Freedom from Hindus) echoed across protest sites. The song “Jab sab but tod diye jaayenge, bas Allah ka naam rahega” (“When all idols are broken, only Allah’s name shall remain”) was not fringe. It was mainstream. And it was celebrated.

This same contempt now fuels the global narrative, where being a proud Hindu in the West is considered an act of aggression, and where Indian immigrants are seen not as contributors, but cultural contaminants.

Are Hindus “invading” the West?

Contrary to the far-right and leftist narrative, Hindus aren’t flooding Western countries. As per Pew Research (2024):

Hindus make up only 5% of the global migrant population. Though 94% of Hindus live in India, only 57% of global Hindu migrants are from India. In contrast, Christians form 47% and Muslims 29% of global migrants.

The “Hindu invasion” is a myth, an imaginary construct, a bogeyman to manufacture hate.

From Dublin to Dismantling Hindutva: A global war on Hindus?

The Dublin assault and its casual dismissal by mainstream media is more than just a reporting failure. It is a symptom of a larger disease — a civilisational bias against Hindus that spans continents, cultures, and ideologies.

From hate crimes on the streets of Ireland and America to academic witch hunts like Dismantling Global Hindutva, Hindus today are not just being targeted physically, but also intellectually, politically, and spiritually.

Ambassador Akhilesh Mishra’s tweet is not just a diplomatic protest; it is a call to wake up. To recognise that being Hindu, wearing saffron, reciting shlokas, or simply existing unapologetically, is enough to be branded a target.

The question is no longer whether Hindus are being demonised. The question is: How long will we pretend that it’s not happening?

How online hatred fuels real-world attacks on Indians and Hindus

The Tallaght assault is a chilling reminder that online hate doesn’t just remain on the internet, it metastasizes into real-world violence.

In this case, false accusations against the Indian victim were first circulated online, accusing him of inappropriate behaviour near children. These baseless claims spread like wildfire on local WhatsApp groups and Facebook pages, ultimately emboldening a mob to hunt him down, strip him, beat him, and leave him bleeding on the street.

OpIndia,11/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/syrian-govt-led-by-former-isis-terrorist-ahmed-al-sharaa-unleashes-brutal-crackdown-on-druze-community-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-sweida-violence/,Syrian govt led by former ISIS terrorist Ahmed al-Sharaa unleashes brutal crackdown on Druze community: All you need to know about the Sweida violence,"What began as a localised tribal scuffle in southern Syria has now snowballed into a full-blown humanitarian and geopolitical crisis, with Israel attacking Damascus to stop its persecution of the Druze. The Druze-majority province of Sweida, long considered a relatively stable enclave in a strife-torn country, has plumbed into chaos after violent clashes erupted between Druze self-defence militias and armed Sunni Bedouin tribes.

The Syrian government’s decision to intervene, ostensibly to restore order, has instead drawn fierce criticism, with eyewitnesses and human rights observers accusing Damascus of using the unrest as a pretext to carry out a brutal crackdown on the Druze community.

As the conflict spirals, disturbing reports have emerged of field executions, looting, and arson carried out by state forces and their allies. The violence has laid bare the fragile nature of Syria’s post-Assad political transition, with interim president Ahmed al-Sharaa, himself a former jihadist commander, struggling to maintain legitimacy among minority groups.

What was once framed as a peacekeeping operation is now seen by many Druze as a calculated campaign of ethnic and sectarian cleansing, pushing the region toward open rebellion and international intervention.

Syrian officials have faced allegations of conducting summary executions of civilians in the Druze-dominated Sweida. Damascus sent troops to the region after Druze fighters and Sunni Bedouin tribes clashed, which killed several people, including women and children. Afterwards, the country’s defence minister Murhaf Abu Qasra declared a ceasefire in the city on 15th July as government forces arrived in the morning.

The “notables and dignitaries” of the city had reached an agreement, he stated and added that government forces would “respond only to the sources of fire and deal with any targeting by outlaw groups.” Nonetheless, altercations were witnessed as did complaints of human right breaches by security personnel.

The locals accused government troops and their allies of tearing through Druze neighbourhoods. They informed AFP that the development had little impact on the ground. The interior ministry also admitted that the conflicts persisted into the evening.

On the same day, the United Kingdom-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights unveiled that 21 members of the minority group had been killed in and around the region by Syrian government forces and their aides.

According to the war monitor, the violence which broke out since early 13th July already claimed the lives of at least 248 people, comprising 92 Druze and 28 of them were civilians. The observatory previously highlighted that forces from the “defence and interior ministries carried out field executions of 12 (19 per some reports) civilians after storming the Radwan family guest house in the city of Sweida.”

It further mentioned that armed groups associated with the government were also accountable for the shooting of three siblings in the presence of their mother in Sweida province. Rayan Maarouf, the editor-in-chief of the Suwayda 24 news website revealed that security forces had been involved in “savage practices.”

He pointed out that there have been instances of brutal murders of civilians and expressed, “dozens of them, yet we do not possess accurate figures.” Suwayda 24 further informed that more than 200 people had been injured. Social media posts featured videos of armed combatants abusing Druze prisoners and shaving their beards.

The agency disclosed that the defence ministry employees took part in “systematic acts of vandalism targeting civilian homes and property” and “stealing the contents of homes, smashing doors and windows, and then setting fire to some of them” among other acts of crimes. Men in military outfits were observed robbing and burning houses as well as liquor stores.

The government troops entered the city with Bedouin fighters and accompanied them in attacking the Druze, according to the observatory, Druze leaders and witnesses. Gunfire and dead bodies laying on empty streets were reported by an AFP correspondent who landed in Sweida soon after the forces.

“Catastrophic” is how one Suweida local described the situation, adding that indiscriminate firing has caused residents to “flee towards the countryside” in spite of a curfew imposed by Syrian authorities, reported BBC Arabic.

Concern among the Druze increased when Islamist groups connected with the Syrian government joined the conflict leading a prominent member of the community to demand “international protection.” The majority of Druze religious leader also announced that they were in favour of the government’s deployment following the Bedouin violence.

However, they later called for armed resistance as the unrest escalated and voiced, “We are being subject to a total war of extermination,” and urged the Druze population “to confront this barbaric campaign with all means available.”

The authorities have been ordered to “take immediate legal action against anyone proven to have committed a transgression or abuse, regardless of their rank or position,” according to a statement released by former Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) commander and current interim president Ahmad al-Sharaa.

Tit-for-tat kidnappings and attacks between local Bedouin tribes and Druze armed forces in the southern province sparked bloodshed two days after a Druze businessman was kidnapped on the highway to Damascus. This marked the first deployment of Syrian government forces to Suweida since the Islamist-led rebels ousted President Bashar al-Assad in December.

Israel enters the conflict

Israel conveyed that after two days of deadly sectarian riots, it had targeted the government forces in the vicinity of Sweida as they moved into the largely Druze city. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu maintained that the government “intended to use (them) against the Druze.” Hence, he ordered strikes on forces and weapons in the area.

Israel with its own Druze population has promised to defend the members of the community who are living in Syria. It views any military deployment south of Damascus as a security hazard and has cautioned the Syrian government against the same. It vowed to continue the assault to protect the group.

On the other hand, the Syrian foreign ministry insisted that the strikes killed several civilians and members of the security forces, but failed to offer any exact numbers. The ministry denounced the Israeli attacks in a statement.

It termed them as “a reprehensible example of ongoing aggression and foreign interference in the internal affairs of sovereign states” and “a blatant violation of the sovereignty of the Syrian Arab Republic.”

Israel, nevertheless, complied with the Trump administration’s request to stop its strikes. The United States even deployed tanks to the troubled area. According to the country’s Syria envoy Tom Barrack, the US is communicating with all parties “to navigate towards calm and integration.”

The U.S. official claimed the Syrian government had informed Israel in advance that it was sending tanks to the Sweida area in southern Syria and stressed this was not an action directed at Israel but an attempt to restore order in internal clashes between Druze militias and a… https://t.co/a7SzPzx9AV — Barak Ravid (@BarakRavid) July 15, 2025

The recent camaraderie between Donald Trump and Ahmed al-Sharaa surprised many, as the former referred to the ex-Islamic terrorist as a “young, attractive and tough guy.” Washington even rescinded the $10 million bounty on his head and removed sanctions placed on Syria.

With the overthrow of Assad regime, the Jewish state has adopted a tough posture towards Syria’s new authorities, arguing it does not want terrorists along its borders. Israeli forces have executed hundreds of airstrikes on Syrian military targets and taken control of a United Nations-patrolled buffer zone on Syrian territory near the Golan Heights border.

Who are the minority Druze community

The majority of the nearly one million members of the Druze Arab sect reside in Syria, Lebanon and Israel. The group which originated in Egypt in the eleventh century, is an offshoot of Ismailism, branch of Shia Islam that forbids marriages and conversions to or from the faith.

The Druze are mostly found in three major provinces in the southern part of Syria, near the Israeli-ruled Golan Heights. They primarily reside in the Sweida province and a few Damascus suburbs, especially in Ashrafiyat Sahnaya and Jaramana to the south.

The Golan Heights, a strategically located plateau that Israel annexed in 1981 after capturing it from Syria during the 1967 Six-Day War is inhabited by around 20,000 Druze. There are about 25,000 Jews also staying in over 30 villages on the territory.

When Israel took over Golan, the majority of the Druze who identify as Syrian, turned down an offer of Israeli citizenship. Israeli residency cards were issued to those who declined although they are not regarded as the country’s citizens.

There is a Druze diaspora outside of the Middle East, especially in North America and Australia. Their population was expected to be over 700,000 until Syria’s civil conflict broke out in 2011. The Druze have been migrating to southern Syria since the 16th century, to what is now known as Jabal al-Druze or Druze Mountain in Sweida province, according to historian Sami Makarem’s book “The Druze Faith.”

During the ten-year civil war, the Druze who form the majority in the Suwayda region in southern Syria were pushed between the forces of the previous Assad administration and extremist organisations. Druze militias had retained a strong hold on Suweida, resisting appeals to join the security forces.

As the nation then took pride in its secular and Arab nationalist system, religious freedom was ensured under the strict control of the Assad family. Ahmed al-Sharaa also promised to safeguard them, however, his government is regarded with suspicion by them and other minorities.

The new 23-member Syrian cabinet unveiled in late March only featured one Druze member, Minister of Agriculture Amjad Badr, despite the transitional government’s commitment to incorporate minorities, including the Druze.

Earlier, many Druze citizens were slain including extrajudicially, as a result of sectarian warfare against their militias by Syrian transitional government armed forces and associated outfits that started on 28th April. Likewise, Christian and Alawite minority communities faced severe persecution few months after the new administration took charge.

Ahmed al-Sharaa’s ties to terrorism

The war name of Ahmed al-Sharaa was Abu Mohammad al-Jawlani. The United States classified him as a terrorist and the United Nations (UN) proscribed him. Over the past 20 years, he held significant positions in global terrorist organisations like Al Qaeda and ISIS. He was designated a global terrorist in 2013.

He collaborated closely with ISIS chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and Al Qaeda’s Aiman al-Zawahiri. He was instructed by the former to start a local outfit to provide a front for Al Qaeda Iraq and Syria during the 2011 uprising against the Assad regime. The Al-Nusrah Front also called Jabhat al-Nusrah or Jabhat Fatah al-Sham was founded by him in 2012.

This UN-designated terrorist group was officially acknowledged as the Syrian branch of Al Qaeda. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham or HTS became the new name for the Jabhat Fatah al-Sham in 2017. Its main objectives were to overthrow the Assad government and establish an Islamic Caliphate.

The group spearheaded a swift and widespread assault and seized areas which were under the Assad government. Afterward, retaliatory killings became rampant in Syria following Ahmed al-Sharaa’s takeover as his Sunni hardliner supporters and radicals targeted people from minority communities.

Therefore, while some Druze opposed Bashar al-Assad’s dictatorial government, they are also wary of Ahmed al-Sharaa, an Islamist leader with a history of perpetrating Islamic jihad. Reservations about some of their leaders being left out of his national discussion processes have been presented by them.",began localised tribal scuffle southern syria snowballed full blown

The first stages of the initiative, started in 2014, were headed by archaeologist K Amarnath Ramakrishna.

However, a significant political dispute between the Tamil Nadu government and the centre has unfolded by his repeated transfers and the Archaeological Survey of India’s (ASI) reservations about his excavation report.

K Amarnath is now appointed as the Director of the National Mission on Monuments and Antiquity (NMMA) in Greater Noida. He was employed as the Director of the National Mission on Monuments and Antiquity in New Delhi prior to the transfer, which occurred six months after his last assignment. He had previously spent three months in the position of Director for Excavation and Exploration.

K Amarnath was ordered to modify his report by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), however, he denied to comply, leading to a fierce war of words between the central and state governments.

How it all began: The Keeladi findings and its significance

Keeladi also known as Keezhadi is on the Vaigai river basin, situated in the Sivaganga district, approximately 12 kilometers southeast of Madurai. Excavations were started more than ten years ago at the Pallichanthai Tidal in Keeladi which was once a 100-acre coconut grove by Amarnath Ramakrishna, the ASI’s superintending archaeologist at the time. Keeladi stood out among the over 100 locations he had selected for excavation along the Vaigai River.

Over 7,500 ancient artefacts, such as wells, drainage systems and wall structures were discovered there, pointing to a thriving and advanced urban society. These materials were disclosed to be more than 2,160 years old, dating to the second century BCE (Before Common Era) which coincides with Tamil history’s Sangam period, according to carbon dating.

The ASI conducted the first three of the eight rounds of excavations. After the Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology (TNSDA) assumed responsibility for the project, the artefacts accumulated to over 18,000, which included pottery, inscribed potsherds, gold ornaments, copper articles, semi-precious stones, shell and ivory bangles, glass beads, spindle whorls, terracotta seals, and weaving tools.

The location produced more than 120 potsherds with Tamil Brahmi inscriptions. The discovery alongside thousand inscribed potsherds from other areas demonstrated the script’s continued existence in the region. Copper needles, clay seals, spinning whorls, yarn hanging stones, terracotta spheres, and earthen containers for liquids alluded to different stages of the weaving industry.

They also indicated that Keeladi was a strong, well-planned and sophisticated urban community with traces of businesses like beadmaking, dyeing and pottery. The artistic, culturally diverse and affluent lifestyle of the Keeladi people is reflected in gold decorations, copper objects, semi-precious stones, shell bangles, ivory bangles and ivory combs.

Beads made of carnelian and agate reflected importation through business networks. Furthermore, their recreational interests had been disclosed through the uncovering of terracotta and ivory dice, gamesmen and signs of hopscotch which also revealed the presence of an elite society. It was also unearthed that the area’s fertility and cow husbandry were key factors in its development, opening the door for the locals to engage in sea trading and produce an abundance of rice.

The results showcased a far older and more developed civilisation than previously believed, pushing the Sangam Age in Tamil Nadu back to about 800 BCE, as per reports. The Sangam Age, also known as the Tamil Sangam period, is a significant period in the history of South India. It was named for the Sangam, an assembly of Tamil poets and academics, saw a flourishing of literature and culture in southern India. It was generally accepted to have occurred between approximately 300 BCE and 300 CE (Common Era).

The Keeladi objects displayed certain symbols that were similar to those of the Indus Valley Civilization. However, there is cultural separation of roughly 1,000 years and scholars anticipated that more research would shed light on this relationship.

Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology asserted that Keeladi possessed all the hallmarks of an urban civilisation, including brick buildings, upscale goods and evidence of both domestic and international trade. It presented itself as a highly developed and hard-working civilisation and provided proof of Tamil Nadu’s urban life and settlements throughout the Early Historic Period. Additionally, Keeladi only strengthened Sangam Literature’s legitimacy.

Strong structures orientated in cardinal directions unveiled systematic urban planning and pot fragments with Tamil Brahmi inscriptions confirmed a literate culture. The sun and moon graffiti revealed the people’s astronomical awareness.

Keeladi was an urban town from the Sangam era and the cultural deposits discovered during the fourth phase of excavations could be easily dated to a time between the sixth and first centuries BCE, according to a 2019 report from the Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology. One of the six samples sent to the United States for carbon testing was dated 580 BCE. It was taken at a depth of 353 centimetres.

Notably, according to the findings presented in the report, the Keeladi artefacts date back approximately 300 years earlier than the previously believed 3rd century BCE.

Ramakrishna’s discovery and subsequent transfer

Keeladi was found by Amarnath Ramakrishna, who supervised the first two seasons of excavations from 2014 to 2016 and handed over a 982-page report to ASI Director General V. Vidyavathi. The report’s twelve chapters provided an explanation of the excavation’s goals and historical context.

The 23 samples that were dated using Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) at the Beta Analytical Lab in Florida of the United States were covered in a different chapter. It also incorporated research on floral and faunal remains from the site to arrive at the period, as well as discoveries from other universities, as per reports.

The first two phases of excavation at Keeladi yielded about 5,800 artefacts after which Ramakrishna was transferred to Assam. The action was reportedly viewed as a setback to the effort. The centre was accused by critics of purposefully sabotaging the excavations because it had committed to release funds and support for additional digging, but postponed both.

Meanwhile, the excavations had already progressed into their third phase under archaeologist PS Sriraman. Interestingly, Sriraman announced that there was no continuity in the brick constructions that had been found earlier, after 400 square meters of excavation. As a result, claims emerged from Tamil Nadu that the centre was actively ‘downplaying’ Keeladi’s prominence, aided by the usual political narratives of anti-North India sentiments that is seen in Tamil political discourse.

TN Govt took up excavation project after ASI stopped, found 13,000 more items

The ASI halted excavations at the site, arguing that the third phase produced no significant outcomes. However, the work was taken over by the Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology in 2017 and thousands of artefacts have since been unearthed. The ninth phase of the excavations was launched by Chief Minister MK Stalin in April 2023 and ended in September of the same year.

The Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology has been able to uncover more than 13,000 items and acquire radiocarbon dates from 580 BCE to 200 CE. The excavations, entered their tenth phase by 2024-2025 and already produced hundreds of antiques.

Furthermore, a 30-foot-long new structure has recently been found at the third trench of the Keeladi excavation after ASI ruled out the possibility of any noteworthy discovery at the site. The bricks used in this new structure are identical in design and make to those used in other parts.

“The bricks used in this new structure are identical in design and make to those used in other parts of Keeladi, strengthening the authenticity of the findings. Earlier studies by Amarnath Ramakrishna’s team had already suggested the area might have housed industrial zones,” V Marappan, Professor of History at Presidency College, outlined while talking to The Federal.

He added, “These new findings raise questions about whether other sections of the site remain unexcavated underground.” The new structure, east-west orientated was discovered 90 centimetres below the surface on the western side. Its length is estimated to be approximately 10 meters. According to archaeologists, it might have been an industrial building or a workshop.

Madras High Court intervenes

The matter made its way to the judiciary in the interim. Judges from the Madras High Court intervened and travelled to the excavation site. They asked the ASI to carry on with the excavations and permit the involvement of the Tamil Nadu Department of Archaeology. The archaeology department of the state followed the instruction.

It had been working on it since the third phase of excavation, giving a more dramatic turn to the events. The court’s Madurai bench in 2019 pronounced that the excavations should not stop since significant advancements in Tamil civilisation had been uncovered while considering a number of petitions that sought an order to the state and the centre to preserve the archaeological sites in Tamil Nadu.

The public would learn more about Tamil civilisation through the archaeological excavations, thus Division Bench consisting of Justices D. Krishnakumar and R. Vijayakumar advised the relevant authorities to ensure that they were carried out without any obstacles.

The court even ordered the centre to send back Amarnath Ramakrishna to Tamil Nadu within 15 days to continue the excavations. Amarnath Ramakrishna, who had been moved back to the state, put forth his report on the first two stages of excavation in January 2023.

Last year, the High Court even sent a notice to the centre demanding the ASI to release the report that was provided following the first two stages of the excavations. The centre received notice regarding the petition filed by Madurai resident P. Prabhakar Pandian from the bench.

The state and the centre were also instructed to submit more counter-affidavits to several public interest litigation petitions concerning the excavations, in the same year. It ordered the authorities to present the rebuttal affidavits to the 2016 and 2017 petitions which had asked the relevant authorities for guidance on how to proceed with the excavations at Keeladi rather than shutting down the site.

One of the petitions asked the government to establish a “site museum” at Keeladi. Stalin opened a Rs 18.43 crore Keeladi museum in March 2023 on two acres.

The Madurai bench even granted the Archaeological Survey India’s request to relocate the artefacts from the excavation to its Dehradun lab for further scientific analysis, in 2016. It was instructed to notify the state’s archaeology commissioner prior to the move. The commissioner was told to record videos and take pictures of the items. The ASI was given directions to return the objects to Tamil Nadu and provide a report to the court.

Controversy erupts between the Centre, Tamil Nadu govt

The 982-page final report was given by Ramakrishna in January 2023, following preliminary and interim submissions in 2016 and 2017, respectively. It had been with the ASI for almost two and a half years and it wrote to Ramakrishna in May seeking a revision.

The Archaeological Survey of India raised concerns regarding the dating and profoundity of specific outcomes. It underscored that the evidence for the earliest period seemed to be quite early and stated that it needed further examination.

According to the letter, “the three periods require proper nomenclatures or re-orientation.” It remarked that the “8th century BCE to 5th century BCE for Period I requires concrete justification.” It also noted that “just mentioning depth for the available scientific dates is not enough but the layer number should also be marked for comparative consistency analysis.” The ASI also demanded that the manner in which dates were presented should also be amended.

However, Amarnath Ramakrishna refused to modify his results, maintaining that his research was sound from a scientific standpoint and supported by strict archaeological standards. He maintained that material culture, stratigraphic sequences and even Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) corroborated the report’s chronology.

A number of Tamil Nadu political groups, including the ruling-Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), the Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi and historian R. Balakrishnan, denounced the ASI’s move as an attempt to stifle Tamil culture. They accused that the failure to recognise Keeladi’s importance was motivated by politics.

On the other hand, Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, the Union Minister for Culture, stated that additional scientific research was necessary to validate Ramakrishnan’s conclusions because they lacked technical support. He asserted that a single finding could not alter the entire discourse and therefore, more data, outcomes and proofs were needed to be collected.

Shekhawat stated that Tamil Nadu is a vital part of India and that its history should be honoured using knowledge based on science rather than polarising opinions. He informed Stalin that the union government would not hesitate to publish any reports and would be delighted to support the state if the research was validated by science.

The union minister declared that more convincing evidence is required for the report to be accepted by the scientific community. He even questioned was the Tamil Nadu government had been reluctant to work with the centre on this matter due to which the conflict has persisted.

“People holding such positions are trying to use that to grow regional sentiments. That is not fair. We have to be very cautious. Let archaeologists, historians, and technical experts discuss this, instead of politicians,” he mentioned.

However, Thangam Thennarasu, Tamil Nadu’s Archaeology Minister, charged that the union government treats Tamils as second-class citizens. He complained, “They also refused to allocate funds for the excavations and allowed the report to gather dust for two years. Now they say there is no adequate evidence. Every time they reject Tamil history, only the method of rejection changes.”

Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam’s (MDMK) Vaiko also claimed that the centre was attempting to promote “a non-existent Sanskrit civilisation” while repressing Tamil civilisation.

“How many obstacles do Tamils face? We have been fighting against all of them for thousands of years, and with the help of science, we have been establishing the antiquity of our race. Yet some minds refuse to accept it. It’s not the statements that need to be corrected, it’s some minds,” MK Stalin recently shared on social media last month while reacting on Ramakrishna’s recent transfer.

Communist Party of India (Marxist) MP from Madurai S Venkatesan expressed, “Transferring an official is not in itself a major issue, it is part of administrative procedures. But Amarnath Ramakrishna worked on the Keeladi excavation for eight years, without compromising on the truth. He was removed, reassigned and denied the opportunity to publish his findings. Only after court intervention was he allowed to write the report.”

He conveyed that the ASI had promised the court and Parliament that the report would be released in 11 months, but that deadline had not been fulfilled while the centre now wants more scientific proof at the final stage. “The message is clear: If you do not align with our views, this is what will be done to you. This is not just about an individual, it’s a discriminatory act against Tamil Nadu and against South Indian history itself,” he alleged.

The AIADMK (All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam) which was in power when the Keeladi report was issued, did not comment on the dispute for a long time. On 18th June, however, its senior leader and former minister RB Udhayakumar stated that the union government had requested further data in order to provide “additional corroboration.” He added that his party would be the first one to voice its disapproval if the Keeladi report was rejected.

Stalin accused the party of remaining silent while the centre minimised the importance of the location to which Udhayakumar retorted that his party’s government had approved Rs 55 lakh for the 2018 excavations. Mafoi Pandiarajan, a senior AIADMK leader who helmed archaeology under Edappadi Palaniswamy, praised him as “Keeladi Nayakar” (hero of Keeladi) and gave him credit for proving Tamil antiquity. A veteran DMK leader retaliated, “Their belated pride in Keeladi rings hollow when they put alliance politics above Tamil identity.”

Central government demands excavation report

The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has asked retired superintending archaeologist PS Sriraman to present the official excavation report for the third phase of the Keeladi excavations. He handled the short-lived third phase in 2017 after Ramakrishna’s abrupt transfer and reported that no major discoveries were made.

He retired in 2019 and has been given permission by the agency to write reports on the excavations he supervised in Keeladi, where he headed the third phase of excavations. He was also involved in the work for one season at Kodumanal which is situated on the northern banks of the Noyyal River in the Erode district, between 2017-2018.

According to archaeologists, Kodumanal could be split into two cultural periods: the Megalithic era and the Prehistoric era. During these times, the locals built durable structures, were skilled craftspeople and engaged in trade with several nations.

Sriraman would be writing the report from the ASI office in Chennai. He talked to The Hindu and revealed, “As I had retired, both reports were pending. I sought the approval of the ASI to access the material and prepare the reports. Since all the related materials are in Chennai, I will begin preparing the reports soon.”

He reiterated, “I have sought permission to complete the report since I am retired now. A formal communication from the ASI is expected soon,” while speaking with Deccan Herald. “The ASI instructed me to complete as quickly as possible. I am concentrating more on Kodumanal because it is an individual work – my work while the third phase in Keezhadi is for a shorter period and it was a continuation of work done earlier,” he asserted in conversation with The New Indian Express.

This comes more than a month after Ramakrishna was asked by the ASI to “resubmit” his report following the necessary changes recommended by two experts who reviewed it.

New dawn in India’s history: Traces of parallel civilization

The Keeladi site has unveiled a pivotal chapter in the history of Tamil Nadu. The indication that an artifact belonged to the 6th century BCE by the US laboratory Beta Analytics holds a major significance. They used the method of radiocarbon dating and suggested that it was contemporary with the urbanisation of the Gangetic plains.

The oldest of the 29 radiocarbon samples dated by the Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology since the 2017-18 excavation season was 580 BCE and the most recent was 200 CE. The results indicated that between the sixth century BCE and the second century CE, there was a vibrant urban and industrial civilisation that lasted for 800 years.

Large brick buildings from the Sangam Age had been discovered and provided proof of the development discussed in Sangam literature. Archaeologist K Rajan who is advisor to Tamil Nadu’s archaeology department voiced, “Most samples above the brick structures date to after the 3rd century BCE, while those below go as far back as the 6th century BCE,” reported The Times of India.

With the use of 3D technology and anthropometric measurements from a skull discovered at the Kondagai burial site, archaeologists are one step closer to unveiling the face of the ancient Tamil people who inhabited the Keeladi settlement thousands of years ago. Rajan stated, “Based on the skull, we will reconstruct the age, dietary pattern, determine the gender, and actual face of the person.”

He added, “This places Keeladi alongside the urbanisation of the Gangetic plains, India’s second urbanisation. Of the 29 radiocarbon dates, 12 fall in the pre-Ashokan era, before the 3rd century BCE.”

Over 20 research institutions from India and abroad are working with the state archaeology department to recreate life in Keeladi in 580 BCE. These involve Liverpool University in the United Kingdom, the University of Pisa in Italy, the Field Museum in Chicago, the French Institute of Pondicherry, IIT Gandhinagar and Deccan College.

Animal bones discovered in Keeladi are under examination at the Deccan College. The bones of bulls, buffaloes, goats, cows, sheep, dogs, pigs, antelope and spotted deer were located during excavations. Researchers at Madurai Kamaraj University are looking into ancient animal and human DNA in order to gain further insight into the mixing and human migration of the ancient residents of Keeladi and Kondagai, a Keeladi cluster hamlet.

A single site has produced 29 dates applying this scientific method. “It shows Keeladi was an urban settlement with a literate society and a community of artisans. It was an industrial hub along an ancient trade route linking the east coast port of Alagankulam to Muziris on the west coast via Madurai,” mentioned R Sivanandam, joint director of state archaeology department.

However, the settlement’s original name is still unknown. Towns, streets, palace structures, decorations, gemstones and international trade are part of Sangam literature. “Keeladi has proved that Sangam literature was a lived experience of ancient Tamils and not imaginative stories,” conveyed indologist R Balakrishnan.

At the site, archaeologists uncovered rectangular and cubic pieces of clay and ivory dice that, according to Balakrishnan, are referenced in “Kalithogai” the sixth of the eight anthologies of Sangam literature.

Rajan emphasised, “Keeladi isn’t the only site with roots in the 6th century BCE. Kodumanal, Porunthal, Sivagalai, Adichanallur and Korkai have also yielded dates from that period. Korkai has produced a date as early as 785 BCE, suggesting Sangam-age urbanisation was widespread.”

Only 4% of the 110 acres of cultural deposit at Keeladi have been unearthed by researchers in ten seasons of excavation. The state government intends to execute further excavations and has established a museum to display the discoveries. There are also plans for an on-site museum which will be the first of its sort in the country.

“Tamil Nadu has endured archaeological apathy for far too long until Keeladi sparked a wave of interest among Tamils,” complained Balakrishnan. Rajan expressed, “Keeladi is the first site that transformed the understanding of archaeology in Tamil Nadu.”

Faces from Keeladi

Meanwhile, a first-of-its-kind forensic facial reconstruction project coordinated by experts from Madurai Kamaraj University and Liverpool John Moores University restored the faces of two individuals who lived in the Keeladi region more than 2,500 years ago. Researchers described the facial features as South Indian with signs of ancient Austro-Asiatic people and West Eurasian (Iranian) hunter-gatherers.

The skulls were discovered around 800 meters from the main excavation site at Kondagai, a burial site. They added that more DNA research is required to identify the genetic ancestry.

Professor Caroline Wilkinson, director of Face Lab at Liverpool John Moores University informed, “We used a computer-assisted 3D facial reconstruction system to rebuild the facial musculature and estimate facial features following anatomical and anthropometrical standards. . As the lower jaws of the skulls were missing, we used orthodontic standards to estimate the shapes of the mandibles from cranial measurements and planes,” according to a report in The Times of India.

According to professor G Kumaresan of Madurai Kamaraj University’s genetics department which scanned and sent pictures of the skulls to Liverpool, “It is 80% science and 20% art.” He outlined that the DNA information and the recreated faces could be useful in determining the lineage of Tamils who lived during the Sangam era.

Critical moment in India’s civilisational journey

The 90-by-60-meter excavated area contains artefacts like as dice, unidentified copper coins, glass, shell, ivory, pearl, and terracotta beads, seals and gold decorations. More importantly, it is one of the few locations in Tamil Nadu, along with Arikamedu, Kaveripattinam and Korkai, to produce a broad range of structures, including intricate brick constructions, tank-like drainage systems, double-walled furnaces and terracotta ring wells.

All of this not only indicates a vibrant, literate and successful urbanized community but also emphasizes the advanced nature of Indian civilization. Its origins trace back to the timeline of the Gangetic plains which also illuminate how India has been home to not just one but multiple prime civilizations and flourishing communities residing in both the northern and southern regions of this vast country for many centuries. Furthermore, the discoveries indicated that they were also linked to the external world.

Such developments not only reinforce the deep civilizational roots of this ancient country but also aid in comprehending the elements of our age-old society. The myths surrounding foreigners who landed in the country and established their communities are also debunked by these revelations, which confirm that the nation has been the cradle of multiple ancient advanced settlements displaying city planning, trade, leisure and all indications of a vibrant cultural society.

These discoveries are therefore not merely a matter of pride but are crucial in preserving our civilizational foundations, comprehending and sustaining a continuous connection with our past, as well as understanding our background. Certainly, the sophisticated perspective of our forebears and the societies they formed and preserved over centuries is truly a subject of admiration.

Intellectuals, historians, epigraphists, geologists and archaeology aficionados have all been drawn to Keeladi to analyse the historical relevance it provides to society and it has even prompted several research investigations.

OpIndia,11/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/economist-abul-barkat-arrested-by-muhammad-yunus-regime-bangladesh-had-warned-about-exodus-of-hindus-details/,"Economist, who warned that there would be no Hindus left in Bangladesh if their exodus continued, arrested by Yunus regime: Details","The Muhammad Yunus regime has yet again targeted intellectuals living in Bangladesh. On Thursday (9th July) night, the police arrested renowned economist Abul Barkat from his residence in the Dhanmondi area of Dhaka.

The development was confirmed by Md Nasirul Islam, the Joint Commissioner of Dhaka Metropolitan Police Detective Branch.

A case was registered against Abul Barkat in February this year by the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) of the Yunus regime. The renowned economist was made an accused in a case of embezzlement of funds worth Tk 297.34 crore.

ACC alleged that Abul Barkat, during his stint as the chairman of Janata Bank Ltd (2009-2014), granted loans to 22 companies of AnonTex Group through ‘forgery’ and ‘fraud’ in collusion with the ex-Governor of Bangladesh Bank.

It claimed that Barkat created false records to embezzle money, approved loans against non-existent buildings and factories and overvalued purchased land.

Abul Barkat is the former president of the Bangladesh Economic Association. He is an Economics Professor at the University of Dhaka.

The renowned economist has previously been bestowed with the ‘Order of the Rising Sun’ by the Japanese Government.

He has been a member of Transformation, Integration and Globalization Economic Research’s (TIGER) Scientific Research Advisory Board since 2021.

No Hindus will be left in Bangladesh after 30 years: Abul Barkat

In November 2016, Abul Barkat wrote a book titled, ‘Political economy of reforming agriculture-land-water bodies in Bangladesh.’

He warned that if the rate of exodus of the minority Hindu community continued, then there would not be any Hindus left after 30 years, i.e. 2046.

While speaking about the matter to Dhaka Tribune, “The rate of exodus over the past 49 years points to that direction.”

Abul Barkat highlighted that on average, 632 Hindus leave Bangladesh each day (~2,30,612 annually). He stated that 1.13 crore Hindus left Bangladesh between 1964 to 2013 due to discrimination and religious persecution.

He pointed that the exodus was at peak during the reign of military in Bangladesh, post independence in 1971.

During the book launch, it also came to light 60% of the Hindu population in Bangladesh were rendered landless by the government after their lands were classified as ‘enemy property’ before 1971 and ‘vested property’ after Independence.

Abul Barkat dedicated his book to his friends from childhood, who belonged to ‘Buno’ tribe, but have no trace now.

Muhammad Yunus tired to appease Islamic extremists

Bangladesh witnessed a drastic rise in Islamism after Yunus came to power. He first revoked the ban on the radical Islamist outfit ‘Jamaat-e-Islami.’

Thereafter, he released the leader of the radical outfit ‘Ansarullah Bangla Team (ABT)’ Muhammad Jasimuddin Rahmani.

At the same time, Muhammad Yunus downplayed the targeted attacks on the Hindu community by violent Muslim mobs. He has gone on record from lamenting about attacks on Hindus to saying that the claims of atrocities are ‘exaggerated‘.

In that way, the controversial US asset was able to placate Islamic extremists. Given that Awami Legaue was against Islamism, the interim government first banned its student wing ‘Chhatra League,’ and then the parent party.

Under the watch of Muhammad Yunus, Bangladesh saw a drastic rise in vigilante Muslim mobs, which unleashed violence under the pretext of protecting the tenets of Islam.

These mobs were largely unorganised and called themselves ‘Tawhidi Janata (meaning Revolutionary People).’ They came under the spotlight over acts of vandalism and harassment of people.

The Yunus regime introduced new textbooks for primary and secondary students, which falsely claimed that the first declaration of independence of Bangladesh was made by Ziaur Rehman (a favourite icon of Muslim hardliners in Bangladesh).

The interim government also appointed a Hizb ut-Tahrir terrorist named Mohammad Azaz as the administrator for the Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC).

The situation had become so grim that Bangladeshi ambassador to Morocco Mohammad Harun Al Rashid was forced to slam the Muhammad Yunus-led interim government in a scathing Facebook post in March this year.",muhammad yunus regime yet targeted intellectual living bangladesh thursday 9th july night police arrested renowned economist abul barkat residence dhanmondi area dhaka development confirmed md nasirul islam joint commissioner dhaka metropolitan police detective branch case registered abul barkat february year anti corruption commission acc yunus regime renowned economist made accused case embezzlement fund worth tk 297 34 crore acc alleged abul barkat stint chairman janata bank ltd 2009 2014 granted loan 22 company anontex group ‘forgery’ ‘fraud’ collusion ex governor bangladesh bank claimed barkat created false record embezzle money approved loan non existent building factory overvalued purchased land abul barkat former president bangladesh economic association economics professor university dhaka renowned economist previously bestowed ‘order rising sun’ japanese government member transformation integration globalization economic research’s tiger scientific research advisory board since 2021 hindu left bangladesh 30 year abul barkat november 2016 abul barkat wrote book titled ‘political economy reforming agriculture land water body bangladesh ’ warned rate exodus minority hindu community continued would hindu left 30 year e 2046 speaking matter dhaka tribune “the rate exodus past 49 year point direction ” abul barkat highlighted average 632 hindu leave bangladesh day 2 30 612 annually stated 1 13 crore hindu left bangladesh 1964 2013 due discrimination religious persecution pointed exodus peak reign military bangladesh post independence 1971 book launch also came light 60 hindu population bangladesh rendered landless government land classified ‘enemy property’ 1971 ‘vested property’ independence abul barkat dedicated book friend childhood belonged ‘buno’ tribe trace muhammad yunus tired appease islamic extremist bangladesh witnessed drastic rise islamism yunus came power first revoked ban radical islamist outfit ‘jamaat e islami ’ thereafter released leader radical outfit ‘ansarullah bangla team abt ’ muhammad jasimuddin rahmani time muhammad yunus downplayed targeted attack hindu community violent muslim mob gone record lamenting attack hindu saying claim atrocity ‘exaggerated‘ way controversial u asset able placate islamic extremist given awami legaue islamism interim government first banned student wing ‘chhatra league ’ parent party watch muhammad yunus bangladesh saw drastic rise vigilante muslim mob unleashed violence pretext protecting tenet islam mob largely unorganised called ‘tawhidi janata meaning revolutionary people ’ came spotlight act vandalism harassment people yunus regime introduced new textbook primary secondary student falsely claimed first declaration independence bangladesh made ziaur rehman favourite icon muslim hardliner bangladesh interim government also appointed hizb ut tahrir terrorist named mohammad azaz administrator dhaka north city corporation dncc situation become grim bangladeshi ambassador morocco mohammad harun al rashid forced slam muhammad yunus led interim government scathing facebook post march year

The Bill, titled the Maharashtra Public Security Bill 2024, was passed in the state Assembly on Thursday (10th July) through a voice vote as some opposition members opposed the Bill.

CM Devendra Fadnavis tabled the Bill in the Assembly, which intends “to provide for effective prevention of certain unlawful activities of left-wing Extremist organisations or similar organisations and matters connected therewith or incidental thereto”.

Introduced the ‘Maharashtra Special Public Security Bill 2024’ which aims to eradicate Naxalism evolved from left-wing extremism..

(विधानसभा, मुंबई | दि. 10… pic.twitter.com/lXv3rIZesB — Devendra Fadnavis (@Dev_Fadnavis) July 10, 2025

The Bill was presented in the Assembly after being reviewed by 25-member Joint Committee headed by Revenue Minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule and included several senior leaders. CM Fadnavis said that the Bill has been finalised after considering the suggestions from the public. “We studied over 12,500 suggestions and objections from the public before finalizing the draft. It is a balanced and progressive law more advanced than similar laws in states like Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, and Jharkhand,” the CM said. He highlighted that around 64 left-wing organisations are currently active in Maharashtra, which is the highest number across all states.

Opposition raises concerns about the Bill

The lone CPI (Marxist) MLA in the Assembly, Vinod Nikole, opposed the Bill, saying that the law would be misused. “I am the only MLA from the Left party. Violent action should be curbed. There is MCOCA and UAPA. The CM has ended Naxalism in Gadchiroli, but I am opposing this Bill as it can be misused,” Nikole said. Amongst others who opposed the Bill were Rohit Pawar (NCP-SP), Bhaskar Jadhav and Varun Sardesai (Shiv Sena UBT), and Vishwajeet Kadam (INC). They registered opposition regarding some clauses in the Bill, including the term ‘urban naxal’. They claimed that some of the suggestions of the joint select committee were not included in the revised bill.

Highlights from the Bill

Allaying the concerns of the opposition, CM Fadnavis said that the Bill is not aimed at targeting Left parties or those criticising the government. The CM assured that the state government recognised dissent and citizens’ right to protest, and that the Bill is meant to punish those who wish to overthrow the established institutions of the country. “Some members have expressed apprehensions, but this Act is not against any left-wing political party. This is against those organisations which are inciting people to overthrow the Indian Constitution. This is for the internal security of the country. It is not against left-wing parties like CPI or CPI (M). We, in fact, respect them even though we have different ideologies. It is against those organisations whose motive is to demolish the established institutions of our country. They will face action,” Fadnavis said.

Explaining the reasons that led to the introduction of the Bill in the Assembly, Devendra Fadnavis said that the influence of the Maoist ideology is growing in the urban and rural areas of the state, particularly in districts like Gadchiroli and Konkan. He said the Maoists, who are facing extinction, are “trying to brainwash the youth of urban areas and make them stand up against the democratic system”.

The Bill seeks to ban individuals and organisations indulging in or promoting violence, guerrilla warfare, or attempting to destabilise the government through unlawful means. Justifying the legislation, Fadnavis said that the existing laws like the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) come into effect after the unlawlful activities has taken place, but the Bill includes preventive measures such as early intervention before the erruption of violence.

The Bill penalises any ‘unlawful activity’, which is defined as “any action taken by an individual or organization whether by committing an act or by words either spoken or written or by sign or by visible representation or otherwise, (i) which constitute a danger or menace to public order, peace and tranquility; or (ii) which interferes or tends to interfere with maintenance of public order; or (iii) which interferes or tends to interfere with the administration of law or its established institutions and personnel”. The punishment for an unlawful activity ranges from 2 to 7 years of imprisonment. To ensure fair and transparent implementation, the Bill provides for the constitution of a three-member authority, comprising a sitting or retired High Court judge, a district magistrate, and a public prosecutor, to oversee case reviews before prosecution.

Elaborating on the ambit of the legislation, the Chief Minister said that cases of violence during protests will be dealt with by the BNS and that the Bill will only be invoked when an organisation tries to “defy the Constitution or Constitutional authorities”. He added that the Bill targets organisations inspired by extreme Left ideologies which aim to challenge constitutional governance through armed struggle. Citing the example of the CPI (Maoist), Fadnavis said, “These groups reject democratic institutions and seek to replace them”.

Naxalism on the verge of eradication

The menace of Naxalism is nearing its end in the country after the consistent efforts of the government and the security forces. The Maoist cadre are staring at an invevitable end with dwindling numbers of footsoldiers and depleting leadership as a result of collaborative efforst of the central forces and the state police.

The Indian government has resolved to uproot Naxalism from the country by March 2026. To achieve this end, the government has adopted an aggressive military approach to counter Naxal terrorism which entered its last phase under Operation Kagar which was launched by the government in January 2024.

Under the operation, around 1 lakh para-military troops, including the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), its elite CoBRA units, District Reserve Guards DRG), and state police, equipped with modern technology, have been deployed in the left-wing terrorism affected areas to completely uproot the naxal terrorism from its last remaining strongholds. Since the inception of the operation, the security forces have eliminated over 400 naxal terrorists so far while more than 800 Maoists have surrendered. From 2019 to 2025, the central forces, in collaboration with state police, have established a total of 320 camps in Naxal-affected states, including 68 night-landing helipads. The number of fortified police stations, which was 66 in 2014, has now increased to 555.",maharashtra government introduced law check spread maoist ideology state bill titled maharashtra public security bill 2024 passed state assembly thursday 10th july voice vote opposition member opposed bill cm devendra fadnavis tabled bill assembly intends “to provide effective prevention certain unlawful activity left wing extremist organisation similar organisation matter connected therewith incidental thereto” introduced ‘maharashtra special public security bill 2024’ aim eradicate naxalism evolved left wing extremism ‘कडव्या डाव्या विचारसरणीतून’ उद्भवलेल्या नक्षलवादाचा समूळ नायनाट करण्यासाठी ‘महाराष्ट्र विशेष जन सुरक्षा विधेयक 2024’ विधानसभा मुंबई दि 10… pic twitter com lxv3rizesb — devendra fadnavis dev fadnavis july 10 2025 bill presented assembly reviewed 25 member joint committee headed revenue minister chandrashekhar bawankule included several senior leader cm fadnavis said bill finalised considering suggestion public “we studied 12 500 suggestion objection public finalizing draft balanced progressive law advanced similar law state like telangana andhra pradesh odisha jharkhand ” cm said highlighted around 64 left wing organisation currently active maharashtra highest number across state opposition raise concern bill lone cpi marxist mla assembly vinod nikole opposed bill saying law would misused “i mla left party violent action curbed mcoca uapa cm ended naxalism gadchiroli opposing bill misused ” nikole said amongst others opposed bill rohit pawar ncp sp bhaskar jadhav varun sardesai shiv sena ubt vishwajeet kadam inc registered opposition regarding clause bill including term ‘urban naxal’ claimed suggestion joint select committee included revised bill highlight bill allaying concern opposition cm fadnavis said bill aimed targeting left party criticising government cm assured state government recognised dissent citizens’ right protest bill meant punish wish overthrow established institution country “some member expressed apprehension act left wing political party organisation inciting people overthrow indian constitution internal security country left wing party like cpi cpi fact respect even though different ideology organisation whose motive demolish established institution country face action ” fadnavis said explaining reason led introduction bill assembly devendra fadnavis said influence maoist ideology growing urban rural area state particularly district like gadchiroli konkan said maoist facing extinction “trying brainwash youth urban area make stand democratic system” bill seek ban individual organisation indulging promoting violence guerrilla warfare attempting destabilise government unlawful mean justifying legislation fadnavis said existing law like unlawful activity prevention act uapa come effect unlawlful activity taken place bill includes preventive measure early intervention erruption violence bill penalises ‘unlawful activity’ defined “any action taken individual organization whether committing act word either spoken written sign visible representation otherwise constitute danger menace public order peace tranquility ii interferes tends interfere maintenance public order iii interferes tends interfere administration law established institution personnel” punishment unlawful activity range 2 7 year imprisonment ensure fair transparent implementation bill provides constitution three member authority comprising sitting retired high court judge district magistrate public prosecutor oversee case review prosecution elaborating ambit legislation chief minister said case violence protest dealt bns bill invoked organisation try “defy constitution constitutional authorities” added bill target organisation inspired extreme left ideology aim challenge constitutional governance armed struggle citing example cpi maoist fadnavis said “these group reject democratic institution seek replace them” naxalism verge eradication menace naxalism nearing end country consistent effort government security force maoist cadre staring invevitable end dwindling number footsoldiers depleting leadership result collaborative efforst central force state police indian government resolved uproot naxalism country march 2026 achieve end government adopted aggressive military approach counter naxal terrorism entered last phase operation kagar launched government january 2024 operation around 1 lakh para military troop including central reserve police force crpf elite cobra unit district reserve guard drg state police equipped modern technology deployed left wing terrorism affected area completely uproot naxal terrorism last remaining stronghold since inception operation security force eliminated 400 naxal terrorist far 800 maoist surrendered 2019 2025 central force collaboration state police established total 320 camp naxal affected state including 68 night landing helipads number fortified police station 66 2014 increased 555

Four sub-inspectors attached to the New Alipore police station were suspended by Lalbazar on the evening of Wednesday, July 9.

The protesters also launched a demonstration by parking their vehicles on the road from Wednesday morning. They claimed that the police took action because they refused to comply with an alleged “extortion attempt” of the cops. The truckers blocked the intersection road near the police station, causing inconvenience to school students and the general public.

Local sources claimed that the incident began around midnight on Tuesday, July 8, when truckers had parked their vehicles on Brahmabandhab Upadhyay Road and the adjacent New Alipore siding, a routine practice for decades. Around 12:30 AM, the police arrived and began vandalising the trucks under the pretext of ‘illegal parking’. Windows were shattered, and front tyres were deflated.

#WATCH | New Alipore, Kolkata (West Bengal): New Alipore Truck Owners Association alleges that at least 30 trucks were vandalised by New Alipore Police personnel last night over parking issue.

Association member Rajen Singh said, “Cops repeatedly demand money and harass us when we can’t pay. Our trucks have been vandalised earlier as well, but Tuesday’s harassment crossed all limits.” The police denied the harassment allegations but stated that a probe is underway “to ascertain the case details.”

The New Alipore police later persuaded the protesters to disperse by assuring them that action would be taken. Deputy Commissioner (South) Priyobrata Roy said, “We have suspended four sub-inspectors pending further enquiry.” Sources added that prima facie evidence, as sought by Lalbazar’s top brass, indicated that the conduct of the suspended officers was “not in line with the rules of service.”

“At least 30 trucks have been damaged in what we strongly condemn as an unprovoked act of vandalism by the police. The road in question has long been used for truck parking due to its proximity to the railway siding. If the police have an issue with on-road parking near the siding, then the siding needs to be relocated outside the city. We demand a clear explanation from the police—why was such destruction carried out? Who will bear the losses? As members of the trucker community, we are already burdened by relentless extortion and harassment. This latest incident only deepens our sense of injustice. We will not remain silent.

OpIndia,10/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/aadhaar-is-not-a-proof-of-citizenship-ec-tells-the-supreme-court-during-hearing-of-bihar-sir/,"Aadhaar is not a proof of citizenship, EC tells the Supreme Court during hearing of petitions challenging electoral roll revision in Bihar","The Supreme Court on Thursday (10th July) rejected a slew of petitions challenging the ongoing Special Intensive Revision (SIR) exercise in Bihar ahead of the assembly elections in October-November. The court allowed the ECI to continue the SIR in Bihar, but asked the commission to consider Aadhaar, voter ID cards, and ration cards as valid documents during the verification drive.

TMC MP Mahua Moitra, former AAP co-founder Yogendra Yadav, RJD MP Manoj Jha, and Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) were among the petitioners. The petitions, inter alia, argued against the exclusion of Aadhaar cards and Ration cards by the Election Commission of India (ECI) from the list of documents required to be submitted as proof of citizenship to be enrolled as a voter in the electoral roll.

It was the argument of the petitioners that the identification process laid down by the ECI shifts the burden of proof onto citizens and that, considering the high rates of migration and poverty in the state, the requirement of documents specified by the ECI might disenfranchise millions of voters.

After hearing the petitions, a bench of Justices Dhulia and Joymala Bagchi refused to stay the SIR. However, the judges asked the ECI why the said documents could not be accepted under the ongoing SIR exercise, to which Senior Advocate Rakesh Dwivedi, counsel for the ECI, replied, “Aadhar Card cannot be used as proof of citizenship.” Dwivedi said that the Aadhaar card is only proof of one’s identity and not citizenship. “It only shows I am I and you are you,” Dwivedi said.

Noting that the ECI is empowered to conduct an SIR, the Supreme Court expressed concerns over the timing of the exercise as the elections are to be held in a few months. The Court suggested that the Aadhaar Card, the Electronic Electoral Photo Identity Card and the Ration Card should be included by the ECI in the list of required documents under the SIR. However, it left the decision to the discretion of the ECI. The next date of the hearing has been set for 28th July.

Why Aadhaar Card is not a proof of citizenship

Aadhaar Card is not considered proof of citizenship by the government of India. In fact, it is expressly mentioned on the card itself that it is not proof of citizenship. According to the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), “Aadhaar number is devoid of any intelligence and does not profile people based on caste, religion, income, health and geography. The Aadhaar number is a proof of identity; however, it does not confer any right of citizenship or domicile in respect of an Aadhaar number holder.”

The authority describes Aadhaar as a strategic policy tool for social and financial inclusion, public sector delivery reforms, managing fiscal budgets, increasing convenience and promoting people-centric governance. Notably, foreigners legally living in India can obtain Aadhaar number, and therefore it is not linked with citizenship.

In 2022, the Bombay High Court clarified in the case of State of Maharashtra vs UIDAI, that Aadhaar Card was only a proof od indentity and residence and not of citizenship or date of birth. Earlier in 2018, the Supreme Court, in the case of Justice K.S. Puttaswamy (Retd.) and Anr. vs Union Of India, also held that Aadhaar Card was an identity document quoting section 9 of the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016. The provision states that “the Aadhaar number or the authentication thereof shall not, by itself, confer any right of, or be proof of, citizenship or domicile in respect of an Aadhaar number holder”.

The documents recognised by the government of India as proof of citizenship are birth certificates, domicile certificates, and passports. A birth certificate certifies that a person was born in India, and a domicile certificate verifies that a person has resided in a particular state or Union Territory in India.

However, the apec court today asked ECI to consider Aadhaar also for the ongoing Special Intensive Revision process.

Why the ECI is undertaking an SIR

As the Bihar Assembly elections are approaching, the EC is undertaking a Special Intensive Revision (SIR) to eliminate bogus voters and ensure fair and transparent elections. Under the SIR, the EC is rectifying the electoral rolls by removing ineligible, deceased or those voters who might have lost their right to vote due to other valid reasons, and upgrading the voter list by adding new verified eligible voters.

The opposition has been attributing malice to the ECI for conducting the SIR, alleging that the exercise is meant to disenfranchise valid voters. It organised ‘Bihar Bandh’ on 9th July protest in Patna against the SIR. However, this is a routine, regular exercise conducted by the ECI across the country for the upkeep of the electoral rolls. SIR is essential to address issues like rapid urbanisation, unreported deaths, new voters, the potential inclusion of ineligible foreign nationals, particularly, Rohingya and Bangladeshi infiltrators. The verification process began on 25 June 2025 and will continue till 26th July.

OpIndia,10/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/what-is-lora-and-why-is-india-interested-in-it-despite-already-having-brahmos/,What is LORA and why is India interested in it despite already having BrahMos?,"The Indian Air Force (IAF) is said to be looking to include a new missile in its arsenal, the Israeli air-launched LORA (Long-Range Artillery) missile. This is despite India possessing other high-capacity missiles such as BrahMos.

The IAF’s interest in LORA was revealed in early July 2025, weeks following its successful use of the Rampage missile during Operation Sindoor in May. That mission underscored the increasing demand for long-range, precision-guided missiles capable of targeting deep targets without exposing pilots to danger.

What is LORA?

LORA is a quasi-ballistic missile developed by Israeli Aerospace Industries (IAI). It is capable of hitting targets between 400 and 430 kilometres away. In contrast to traditional ballistic missiles, LORA takes a depressed trajectory, which makes it more difficult for enemy radar to detect and target. LORA also employs a “fire-and-forget” system; once fired, the missile can locate its target independently without any assistance from the pilot or aircraft.

This missile employs a combination of GPS and Inertial Navigation System (INS) for targeting. It also has anti-jamming capability, making it more dependable in hostile areas. LORA has various warheads that it can carry and has an accuracy of sufficient enough to hit with less than 10 metres of deviation. Its speed is also noteworthy — around 6,000 km/h — with the ability to hit fast and hard.

LORA has been specifically developed for fighter aircraft such as the Su-30MKI, which India already has in large quantities. A Su-30 can carry up to four LORA missiles on a single mission, with the ability to strike multiple targets simultaneously.

Why LORA, when India has BrahMos?

India already has the BrahMos supersonic cruise missile, which is of similar range, 290–450 km. However, the BrahMos missile’s range has progressively increased over time. Initially capped at 290 km due to restrictions under the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), its range was extended to 450 km after India became a member of the MTCR. Current developments aim to further enhance its reach to approximately 800 km.

Then there is the Rafale’s SCALP missile, the Pralay ballistic missile, and the recently used Israeli Rampage. So what is LORA?

The solution is in capability and versatility. BrahMos is ideal for heavy, low-altitude attacks and is suited best for striking sea-level or ground-level targets. LORA is launched at higher altitudes and takes a ballistic trajectory. Its lofted trajectory makes it a better fit for hitting well-defended, high-value targets deep inside enemy territory.

BrahMos, a joint India-Russia project, is relatively costly, at around Rs 20-30 crore per missile. LORA is expected to be more affordable, simplifying procurement and deployment.

Consequently, the IAF sees LORA as a complementary weapon, not a replacement for BrahMos. Each missile fulfills different strategic needs.

Make in India advantage

In 2023, IAI and Bharat Electronics Limited signed a Memorandum of Understanding to co-produce advanced missile systems. If everything proceeds smoothly, the missile will be manufactured in India under licence from the Israeli firm.

LORA’s lower cost makes it an economical option for mass deployment. It has potential for export under India’s “Make in India” initiative, thereby fostering domestic production and enhancing global market competitiveness.

Additionally, LORA’s larger payload capacity enables it to deliver heavier warheads, increasing its destructive power. Integrating LORA into Indian Air Force jets diversifies the missile arsenal, providing a versatile, high-impact option for various combat scenarios. This strategic addition would strengthen India’s defence capabilities, ensuring a balanced mix of speed, cost efficiency, and firepower alongside BrahMos.

The first squadron is expected to be operational by 2027

The Indian Air Force is negotiating with Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) and Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) to import the LORA missile system. If everything goes according to plan, the initial batch or squadron of 18 LORA missiles may become deployable as early as 2026 or 2027. This would greatly enhance India’s capability to conduct deep and targeted airstrikes, particularly as a counter to expected provocations from immediate neighbours China and Pakistan. It would add to the overall combat capabilities of the IAF as well.",indian air force iaf said looking include new missile arsenal israeli air launched lora long range artillery missile despite india possessing high capacity missile brahmos iaf’s interest lora revealed early july 2025 week following successful use rampage missile operation sindoor may mission underscored increasing demand long range precision guided missile capable targeting deep target without exposing pilot danger lora lora quasi ballistic missile developed israeli aerospace industry iai capable hitting target 400 430 kilometre away contrast traditional ballistic missile lora take depressed trajectory make difficult enemy radar detect target lora also employ “fire forget” system fired missile locate target independently without assistance pilot aircraft missile employ combination gps inertial navigation system in targeting also anti jamming capability making dependable hostile area lora various warhead carry accuracy sufficient enough hit less 10 metre deviation speed also noteworthy — around 6 000 km h — ability hit fast hard lora specifically developed fighter aircraft su 30mki india already large quantity su 30 carry four lora missile single mission ability strike multiple target simultaneously lora india brahmos india already brahmos supersonic cruise missile similar range 290–450 km however brahmos missile’s range progressively increased time initially capped 290 km due restriction missile technology control regime mtcr range extended 450 km india became member mtcr current development aim enhance reach approximately 800 km rafale’s scalp missile pralay ballistic missile recently used israeli rampage lora solution capability versatility brahmos ideal heavy low altitude attack suited best striking sea level ground level target lora launched higher altitude take ballistic trajectory lofted trajectory make better fit hitting well defended high value target deep inside enemy territory brahmos joint india russia project relatively costly around r 20 30 crore per missile lora expected affordable simplifying procurement deployment consequently iaf see lora complementary weapon replacement brahmos missile fulfills different strategic need make india advantage 2023 iai bharat electronics limited signed memorandum understanding co produce advanced missile system everything proceeds smoothly missile manufactured india licence israeli firm lora’s lower cost make economical option mass deployment potential export india’s “make india” initiative thereby fostering domestic production enhancing global market competitiveness additionally lora’s larger payload capacity enables deliver heavier warhead increasing destructive power integrating lora indian air force jet diversifies missile arsenal providing versatile high impact option various combat scenario strategic addition would strengthen india’s defence capability ensuring balanced mix speed cost efficiency firepower alongside brahmos first squadron expected operational 2027 indian air force negotiating israel aerospace industry iai bharat electronics limited bel import lora missile system everything go according plan initial batch squadron 18 lora missile may become deployable early 2026 2027 would greatly enhance india’s capability conduct deep targeted airstrikes particularly counter expected provocation immediate neighbour china pakistan would add overall combat capability iaf well

He was bitten by a puppy while rescuing it from a drain on 28th May. Brijesh ignored the bite as a minor scratch. A month later, he started displaying symptoms of rabies and within days he succumbed to the disease.

Brijesh Solamki, Ziya Faris and Niya Faisal died of rabies.

In May 2025, a 7-year-old girl identified as Niya Faisal died of rabies despite the vaccine in Kerala. Her death came days after 6-year-old Ziya Faris’s death from rabies in Kerala despite having received vaccination. Niya’s mother told media that stray dogs were attracted to a pile of garbage being thrown near her house by the locals. Despite her repeated requests, people did not stop throwing garbage and as a result a pack of stray dogs kept coming near her house. Niya was mauled by the dogs in front of her mother.

Before Niya and Ziya, another 13-year-old child died due to rabies despite getting the vaccine, raising serious concerns over the presence of rabies-infected stray dogs and the quality of vaccine in the state hospitals.

In March 2025, a woman died of rabies allegedly after drinking unboiled milk from an infected cow. The cow had contracted the infection after getting bitten by a stray dog. After the cow started showing symptoms, several people sought the rabies vaccine in the area but the woman who was selling the milk did not take precaution and a few days after consuming the milk, she developed symptoms.

All you need to know about rabies

Rabies is a viral zoonosis spread most often by dogs. It is transmitted through the saliva of an infected animal, typically via a bite or a scratch. There is no cure for rabies once the patient starts exhibiting clinical symptoms, and death is 100% certain within a few days. Even minor exposure can be deadly.

Experts suggest that many people don’t know that even a lick on broken skin or a scratch from an infected dog or any other animal that can transmit the disease is fatal. Initially, flu-like symptoms appear. As time passes, the rabies virus causes confusion, agitation and hydrophobia. Once neurological signs appear, the only thing left is to wait for the patient’s death. There is no cure for the disease once symptoms develop.

The only hope is that rabies is preventable with prompt and appropriate medical care. In practice, this means immediate wound washing and post-exposure prophylaxis, which is a course of vaccines, can prevent the disease from developing. In severe cases, immediate administration of rabies immunoglobulin plays a crucial role in saving the patient. However, if PEP is delayed or omitted, the virus is fatal. In short, rabies is arguably the deadliest disease many Indians neglect. It is a treatable infection. However, without swift action, it becomes an almost certain killer. Rabies is ruthless and does not care about the age or social status of the person. If you are bitten by a dog, get the vaccine immediately, otherwise it will become your death sentence.

How symptoms progress

Rabies typically begins with non-specific early symptoms such as fever, headache and unusual sensations such as tingling, pricking or burning around the site of exposure. As the infection progresses, patients may develop one of two clinical forms.

The first is furious rabies, which is characterised by hyperactivity, excitability, hydrophobia (fear of water) and sometimes aerophobia (fear of air drafts). In a few days, the patient dies due to cardio-respiratory arrest.

The second type is paralytic rabies, which accounts for around 20% of human cases. The progress of infection is slower, with muscle weakness starting around the wound and eventually leading to coma and death. This form is misdiagnosed, contributing to significant under-reporting.

Prevention and precaution

According to the Government of India, mass vaccination of dogs, responsible dog ownership and community awareness is the key to prevention of the disease. According to the World Health Organisation, at least 70% vaccination coverage of the dog population is necessary to break the transmission chain. Ensuring pet dogs are vaccinated on schedule and recognising that any bite, scratch or lick, especially on broken skin, poses a risk are fundamental messages promoted in public education campaigns.

Post-exposure care

In case a person is bitten, licked or scratched by a dog, post-exposure care begins immediately. First, the wound must be thoroughly washed for at least 15 minutes with soap and water. This process physically removes the virus and inactivates it through soap’s lipolytic action. The National Guidelines for Rabies Prophylaxis (2019) confirm that prompt and appropriate wound care, grouped together with PEP, is completely effective in preventing the disease from progressing.

Once the wound is washed properly, post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) requires a full course of rabies vaccines. It should be administered either intramuscularly or intradermally. The latter is endorsed by the Drug Controller General of India as a cost-effective alternative.

The exposure to the rabies virus is divided into three categories.

Category I

This refers to no exposure, such as when the animal simply licks intact skin or touches it without breaking the surface. For these situations, no rabies vaccine or immunoglobulin is required; only general wound cleaning, if necessary, is advised.

Category II

This includes nibbling of uncovered skin (not through clothing), minor scratches or abrasions without bleeding. In these cases, the guidelines call for administration of the rabies vaccine (anti-rabies vaccine, ARV) under either the intramuscular or intradermal schedule. Rabies immunoglobulin is not necessary for Category II exposures.

Category III

This encompasses more serious exposures, transdermal bites or scratches, contamination of mucous membranes or broken skin with saliva, or contact with wild animals such as bats. The Government of India guidelines mandate both rabies vaccine and rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) for all Category III exposures. Notably, according to the guidelines, exposure to all wild animals should be treated as Category III exposure.

WHO emphasises that timely access to standardised, quality-assured PEP can achieve almost 100% protection against rabies. The effective management of rabies relies heavily on a “One Health” approach, integrating community education, dog vaccination and immediate medical response. Government of India and WHO materials highlight that educating communities and engaging health workers and veterinarians is a proven strategy to save lives.

India is also working on the global goal of zero human rabies deaths by 2030. To achieve the goal, according to the experts, awareness, wound washing, PEP and canine vaccination are the key factors.

India’s rabies burden

India bears an outsized share of the global rabies toll. While the government data show only dozens of confirmed deaths each year, for example, 21 deaths in 2022 and 54 in 2024, WHO and independent studies estimate roughly 18,000 to 20,000 deaths in India by rabies. Notably, WHO’s numbers match a 2006 press release of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. In that press release, the ministry categorically stated that there is no exact statistical data available for rabies deaths in India.

WHO suggests that India bears the burden of 36% of rabies deaths worldwide. The huge gap exists because many cases never enter the system. Rabies is not yet a nationally notifiable disease, and deaths in remote areas are often blamed on other causes. Mild exposures are often ignored due to lack of awareness. Studies suggest under-reporting is rampant, meaning the real toll is orders of magnitude higher than official figures.

High-risk groups are particularly affected. Children are the worst hit. Around 30% to 60% of dog-bite victims in endemic regions are under 15. In India, impoverished rural kids, who often play with dogs unsupervised, make up a large slice of deaths. Dogs cause around 96% of human rabies cases, and children account for around 40% of dog-bite exposures.

Other vulnerable groups include the elderly, disabled and urban poor, who may lack swift access to care. In sum, India’s epidemic has stubbornly refused to drop because the underlying conditions, large stray dog populations and low awareness, persist, masking the full scale of the problem.

Preventable, yet unstoppable – What’s going wrong?

Rabies should have been eliminated from the world a long time ago. Modern PEP is highly effective if administered immediately, and it will prevent 100% of rabies. In India, many clinics offer free anti-rabies vaccine and immunoglobulin. However, in practice, these lifesaving therapies often fail to reach the patient.

Reports suggest that many districts lack reliable vaccine and immunoglobulin supplies. Lack of qualified staff is another problem. A Tribune investigation noted that while many government hospitals offer free vaccines, timely access remains a hurdle, especially in rural areas. Furthermore, supply chain gaps, cold chain problems, and long distances mean victims often leave clinics empty-handed. Restocking vaccines timely is another issue. There have been reports even from PGI Chandigarh and medical colleges in Kerala where vaccines were not available for weeks and even months.

Delay and ignorance also add up to the fatal exposure. Families often do not realise the danger. Some patients seek herbal remedies, which are not effective. Seeking traditional healers or doing nothing instead of immediate PEP is tragically common. There is a lack of awareness, especially in rural areas, which leads to such cases and under-reporting.

In short, the medical tools exist, but implementation fails. Victims often present too late. Untreated, the disease becomes “unstoppable”, just as avoidable as it is deadly.

The real driver – India’s growing stray dog population

The scale of India’s stray dog problem is staggering. It drives rabies. Dogs are by far the main reservoir. Around 99% of transmission comes from dog bites. India has millions of free-ranging dogs on its streets. Officially, the number stands at around 6.8 million. However, according to experts, the real number is far higher. Unmanaged garbage, lack of sterilisation, haphazard urban planning and intervention of “dog lovers” is what is causing a rampant increase in the dog population on Indian streets.

Where there are more strays, there are more bites. 37 lakh reported cases of dog bites in 2024 is not a small number and must not be ignored. 4.8 lakh dog bite cases in Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, 3.9 lakh in Gujarat, 3.6 lakh in Karnataka, and 2.6 lakh in Bihar, as per data made available by GoI, is not a small number. Sadly, the numbers mismatch with previous data reported by media houses. According to a report in the New Indian Express, in 2022, Andhra Pradesh reported over 7 lakh dog bite cases, but GoI data says it was 1.9 lakh. There is a huge gap between the two numbers. If the numbers mismatch at such a massive scale, how can the Central Government and State Government work together in controlling the menace?

In short, the ballooning stray dog population, fed by open garbage and patchy spay/neuter programmes, is the primary engine behind India’s rabies problem.

The ABC Rules dilemma – How 2001 changed India’s ability to act

In 2001, India shifted policy dramatically. The Animal Birth Control (Dogs) Rules were introduced under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, banning the killing of stray dogs. Henceforth, local authorities were to curb dog numbers only via humane capture-sterilisation-vaccination-release (ABC/CNR) programmes.

Culling was declared illegal. These rules were reinforced in 2023’s updated ABC guidelines. The Supreme Court and high courts have repeatedly held that local laws cannot override the ABC Rules, effectively barring municipalities from killing or permanently removing dogs.

The blanket no-kill policy may look well-intended, but it has hamstrung authorities in practice. They must now sterilise and vaccinate every captured dog and return it to its original area within days. A recent Punjab and Haryana High Court ruling emphasised that dogs “cannot be kept in shelters indefinitely”; they must go back to the streets after treatment.

For residents, facing aggressive dog packs feels maddening. Citizens injured or killed by strays find no legal recourse to have the animal removed or euthanised.

Meanwhile, the ABC programme itself struggles. Sterilisation campaigns have so far failed to reach the scale needed. For example, Bengaluru authorities report only a 10% drop in street dog numbers from 2019–23, despite increasing sterilisation output by 20%. In effect, the strict ABC framework has often been honoured only on paper. Many dogs remain unsterilised, and any attempt at aggressive control is blocked by legal constraints. The outcome is “an ecosystem of chaos” where the law says one thing but ground reality delivers little, and people remain unprotected.

Dog lovers and the ecosystem of chaos

The management of stray dogs in India has become a polarising battle between frustrated residents and “dog lovers”. On one hand, there are feeders and activists who have no respect for human lives and try to intervene in the process of removal of stray dogs from areas where they do not even live.

These dog lovers and feeders often turn public spaces such as parks and sidewalks into dog-feeding zones. If RWAs try to establish feeding zones as mandated by the law, they oppose. If someone tries to stop them from feeding dogs at random places, these dog lovers and activists become hostile and file complaints at police stations or call the Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) or NGOs with reach to “higher powers”, which is another issue in itself.

There have been reports where dog feeders leave a mess behind. Garbage piles up and dog dung makes its way to the unauthorised feeding areas, attracting more diseases while further fuelling resentment among non-feeders and the general public.

More ominously, a vocal animal-rights fringe actively impedes any removal of dogs. They have challenged municipal catch teams, using law and social media to demand instant release of captured animals. This has left civic agencies cowed. For instance, even after attacks, courts have sided with the no-kill ethic. The judiciary and lawmakers have made it next to impossible to kill even rabid dogs, making the lives of people impossible.

Meanwhile, other human actions worsen the situation. Illegal puppy mills and pet shops add to the crisis. Abandonment of pedigree dogs by illegal dog breeders is one of the reasons for the growing dog attacks. They tend to get violent as they have lived their entire lifetime in closed surroundings and are released into the open. In the end, misplaced compassion is costing lives.

Conclusion

Rabies and the growing dog population is not a “problem”. It is a human survival crisis. Dogs kill children, the poor and other vulnerable communities. People should not have died of rabies, not even one. There must be a balance between compassion and accountability. No one wants cruelty against animals, but at the same time, the no-kill policy is a menace. There is an urgent need to control the dog population and impose strict regulations when it comes to vaccination, sterilisation, dog population control, feeding and caring. No one should have a free hand to stop the authorities from putting human lives as the priority.

In the end, India must treat rabies as seriously as polio or malaria. Political will and resources should match the scale of the problem. While India must work on eliminating the disease, there is also an immediate need to curb the population of stray dogs. Remember, people do not just die of rabies when it comes to dogs, they die because of the injuries they have sustained during the attack as well.

OpIndia,10/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/who-will-amend-the-voter-list-if-not-us-election-commission-asks-in-supreme-court/,Who will amend the voter list if not us: Election Commission asks in Supreme Court during hearing on Bihar electoral roll revision,"The Supreme Court on Friday, 10th July, declined to stay the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in Bihar. The bench of Justices Sudhanshu Dhulia and Joymalya Bagchi also directed the Election Commission of India (ECI) to consider Aadhaar, voter ID cards, and ration cards as valid documents during the verification drive.

However, during the hearing, the apex court raised important concerns about the timing of a special revision of voter lists currently being carried out in Bihar, just months before the state is expected to go to the polls. While the court clarified that there’s nothing wrong with conducting such an exercise, it questioned why this wasn’t done earlier and why it is happening so close to the elections.

The bench said that updating and verifying voter lists is a crucial part of the democratic process, but it should ideally be done promptly. “The issue is not whether the revision should happen or not, but why it is happening now, and not earlier,” the court noted.

The Election Commission (EC), through its lawyer Rakesh Dwivedi, defended the move and asked, “If the Election Commission doesn’t have the authority to revise the voter list, then who will do it?” He further said, regular updates to the voter list are necessary and legally allowed under the Representation of the People Act. He added that it is within the EC’s powers to include or remove names to ensure the list remains accurate.

During the hearing, the Supreme Court requested that the Election Commission clarify three things: whether it has the power to update the voter roll, what process it used for this special update, and why it did it at this time. The court further stated that if the commission had wanted to check the citizenship of voters, particularly in Bihar, it could have initiated the process much earlier. In this regard, the Election Commission told the court that under Article 326 of the Constitution, verifying citizenship is necessary to become a voter in India.

Concerns over rejection of Aadhaar and Voter ID

The court also expressed unease regarding the reports that Aadhaar cards and voter ID cards are not being accepted as valid documents during the process of revision. Senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan, who argued for one of the petitioners, emphasised that almost 7.9 crore individuals can be impacted and expressed puzzlement as to why Aadhaar and voter ID cards are being disregarded.

Opposition leaders challenge EC’s move

More than ten petitions have been filed against this exercise. One of the main petitioners is the NGO Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR). Several opposition leaders have also approached the top court against the EC’s order, including RJD MP Manoj Jha, TMC MP Mahua Moitra, Congress leader KC Venugopal, NCP’s Supriya Sule, CPI’s D Raja, SP’s Harinder Singh Malik, Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Arvind Sawant, JMM’s Sarfaraz Ahmad, and CPI (ML) leader Dipankar Bhattacharya.

These leaders have asked the court to withdraw the EC’s directive for the special revision in Bihar on the grounds of voter suppression and inadequate implementation.

The Election Commission of India is preparing to conduct state assembly elections in Bihar, set to be held later this year. Ahead of the elections, the ECI is undertaking a Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of the electoral roll in the state. Documents are being sought from all the voters so that their names can be included in the voter list again. As soon as the SIR process started, the number of applications for residence certificate in Kishanganj, a Muslim-dominated district of Bihar, increased 5-6 times. This increase in Kishanganj has again raised the questions of infiltration and demographic change in the district.

Applications for residence certificates increased 5 times in Kishanganj: Deputy CM Samrat Chaudhary

Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Samrat Chaudhary has said that on average, 26 thousand to 28 thousand applications were coming to Kishanganj for a residence certificate every month from January to May in 2025. He said that as soon as the process of the Election Commission started, this number increased rapidly.

Chaudhary said that in just 6 days of July, more than 1.28 lakh applications for a residence certificate were received in Kishanganj. He said that this shows that infiltrators are present in large numbers in Kishanganj.

The deputy CM added that documents like PAN card, Aadhar card, and passport take time and proof, while a residence certificate is easily made. Chaudhary has linked this matter to national security. The minister’s remarks have sparked a debate over this issue.

Their concerns are justified because Kishanganj is the only district in Bihar where the Muslim population is more than 60% and the demographic change here has been rapid. Infiltration has also taken place on a large scale in Kishanganj.

Why are Bihar Deputy CM Samrat Chaudhary’s concerns justified?

Samrat Choudhary is not talking about the sudden increase in infiltrators and applications without any reason. Kishanganj has a history behind this. Kishanganj is the only district in Bihar where about 70% of the population is Muslim. This is recorded on paper.

At the time of independence, Kishanganj was a Hindu majority area. But in the last few decades, the demography here has changed very rapidly. Now, the Hindus here are not even one-third. Hindus have become a minority here in the last few decades. The biggest reason for this change is considered to be the illegal influx of Bangladeshi and Rohingya infiltrators.

This district is situated on the border of West Bengal. Bangladeshi infiltrators and Rohingyas have been arrested continuously from here. Last month only, 9 Bangladeshis were arrested here. These infiltrators have been caught here on different occasions. The border of Kishanganj is adjacent to Nepal.

In Kishanganj itself, people forging fake documents like Aadhaar and PAN have been caught. This essentially means that people helping Bangladeshis and Rohingyas are also present here. Besides, there are a large number of Bengali speakers here, which allows these infiltrators to mix with the native population.

The population growth rate of this district has been the fastest in the country. The population of this district has increased at a rate of 3% between 2001 and 2011, which is much higher than the national average. Not only this, but children are also being born in Kishanganj at a faster rate than the national average.

The TFR in Kishanganj is 2.5 times the national average. According to a Reuters report, Kishanganj’s TFR is around 4.9 while the national average is 2.0. The number of children a woman aged 15-49 gives birth to during these years is called her TFR.

If the average TFR of a country is 2.1, then the population remains the same, whereas if it is less than this, then the population decreases. The population is now decreasing in the whole country, whereas in Kishanganj it is increasing twice as fast.

Muslim population increased by 16% in Seemanchal

Kishanganj is a part of the Seemanchal region of Bihar. A report by Dainik Jagran shows that between 1951 and 2011, the share of the Muslim population in the country’s total population increased by 4%, but in these Seemanchal districts, this share has increased by 16% and which is the average of all districts. Not only Kishanganj, but the Muslim population has increased abnormally in adjoining districts like Purnia, Khagaria, Araria and Katihar. Its effect is also visible on the social structure.

Widespread opposition to CAA-NRC in Muslim-dominated Kishanganj

Unsurprisingly, the Muslim-dominated Kishanganj saw vehement opposition to the Citizenship Amendment Act and National Register of Citizens in 2019-2020. Not to forget, the Islamo-leftist cabal ran a ‘Kaagaz nahi dikhayenge’ campaign during anti-CAA-NRC protests.

A 15-year-old Hindu Dalit girl was allegedly lured by a Muslim man on the false promise of marriage, brutally raped, and then held captive in his home for days.

According to Chopan police station, the incident took place on 16th March, 2025. The accused, identified as Shahzad, reportedly called the minor girl to his residence in their village. There, he allegedly raped her while deceitfully assuring her of marriage.

The horror didn’t end with the assault. The girl was forcibly confined within Ansari’s house, effectively held hostage and prevented from leaving or contacting her family. Desperate to see their daughter, when her traumatized parents arrived, Ansari cruelly barred them from meeting her.

Adding layers of brutality to the crime, Ansari allegedly hurled vicious casteist slurs at the girl’s parents and issued death threats against them. Faced with this ordeal, the victim’s mother demonstrated immense courage. She approached the Chopan police station and filed a detailed written complaint, detailing the rape, unlawful confinement, caste-based abuse, and threats.

According to information received in media reports, the police have registered a case against the accused Shahzad under sections 65(1), 127(2), 352, 351(3) of the IPC, section 3/4 of the POCSO Act and sections 3(2)(v), 3(1)(d), 3(1)(DH) of the SC/ST Act. The police have detained the accused and conducted intensive questioning, legal proceedings are going on.

Another incident that shatters the myth of ‘Jai Bhim Jai Meem’

This horrifying incident yet again shatters the carefully constructed narrative of ‘Jai Bhim, Jai Meem’, a slogan that attempts to portray a political alliance or social solidarity between Dalits and Muslims. While this rhetoric is peddled by certain political and ideological groups to forge vote-bank coalitions, the ground reality often tells a starkly different story. Here, a vulnerable Dalit minor girl was not only raped and imprisoned by a Muslim man but her family was also subjected to casteist slurs and violent intimidation.

Far from any shared struggle or mutual respect, the incident exposes deep-seated communal and casteist prejudices, reminding us that social justice cannot be reduced to hollow slogans or opportunistic alliances. Justice for Dalits must not be hijacked by identity politics that conveniently overlook such heinous crimes.",deeply disturbing case emerged sonbhadra district uttar pradesh 15 year old hindu dalit girl allegedly lured muslim man false promise marriage brutally raped held captive home day according chopan police station incident took place 16th march 2025 accused identified shahzad reportedly called minor girl residence village allegedly raped deceitfully assuring marriage horror didn’t end assault girl forcibly confined within ansari’s house effectively held hostage prevented leaving contacting family desperate see daughter traumatized parent arrived ansari cruelly barred meeting adding layer brutality crime ansari allegedly hurled vicious casteist slur girl’s parent issued death threat faced ordeal victim’s mother demonstrated immense courage approached chopan police station filed detailed written complaint detailing rape unlawful confinement caste based abuse threat according information received medium report police registered case accused shahzad section 65 1 127 2 352 351 3 ipc section 3 4 pocso act section 3 2 v 3 1 3 1 dh sc st act police detained accused conducted intensive questioning legal proceeding going another incident shatters myth ‘jai bhim jai meem’ horrifying incident yet shatters carefully constructed narrative ‘jai bhim jai meem’ slogan attempt portray political alliance social solidarity dalits muslim rhetoric peddled certain political ideological group forge vote bank coalition ground reality often tell starkly different story vulnerable dalit minor girl raped imprisoned muslim man family also subjected casteist slur violent intimidation far shared struggle mutual respect incident expose deep seated communal casteist prejudice reminding u social justice cannot reduced hollow slogan opportunistic alliance justice dalits must hijacked identity politics conveniently overlook heinous crime

The incident unfolded at around 9:30 PM on 9th July 2025, when unidentified persons entered the Hindu temple and started breaking the idols.

One of the two wedding processions was proceeding from the Sadharanpur village and went past a mosque in Amarpur gadhi village while playing loud DJ music. Members of the Muslim community reportedly protested, expressing that it was time to offer namaz (prayer), and insisting on stopping the music. Upon the refusal by the wedding party, the argument escalated into a violent attack.

The muslim group reportedly attacked the DJ equipment, broke instruments, and even physically assaulted the procession with sticks and sharp objects. Some of the guests at the Dalit wedding were injured in the attack, including two Dalit men, Pankaj and Vansh, who were seriously injured and were sent to a hospital in Meerut after receiving preliminary treatment in Deoband.

OpIndia,09/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/chipmaker-nvidia-becomes-the-first-4-trillion-publicly-traded-company/,Chipmaker Nvidia becomes the first $4 Trillion publicly traded company powered by its booming AI business,"Nvidia Corporation made history today, becoming the first publicly traded company to surpass a $4 trillion market capitalization. The milestone was reached during intraday trading when the chipmaker’s share price surged to $164.42, briefly pushing its valuation beyond the unprecedented threshold. This achievement cements Nvidia’s position as the world’s most valuable company, outpacing tech giants like Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Google parent Alphabet, and underscores its pivotal role in the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.

Nvidia’s meteoric rise has been driven by its dominance in the AI chip market, particularly its graphics processing units (GPUs), which power the data centres fuelling advanced AI models and cloud services. The company’s stock soared approximately 2.5% in early trading today, closing at $164.32, with a market cap hovering just above $4 trillion. This marks a staggering 1,460% increase in stock value over the past five years, with a year-to-date gain of nearly 22% in 2025 alone.

Nvidia’s ascent to a $4 trillion valuation is a testament to the transformative power of AI, which CEO Jensen Huang has dubbed “the next industrial revolution.” Originally known for its GPUs tailored for PC gaming, Nvidia capitalised on the discovery that these chips are ideally suited for the complex computations required by AI, including large language models like ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini. This strategic pivot has positioned Nvidia as the backbone of the AI infrastructure, with its chips in high demand by tech giants such as Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, and Alphabet, as well as emerging AI players like OpenAI and Tesla.

The company reported $44.1 billion in revenue for the fiscal quarter ending April 2025, a 69% increase from the same period last year, and a net income of $18.78 billion, up 26%. Nvidia’s data centre business, which supplies AI chips, has been the primary driver of this growth, with revenue surging 73% year-on-year. “There is one company in the world that is the foundation for the AI Revolution, and that is Nvidia,” wrote Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives in a June 27 research note.

Global spending on AI infrastructure is projected to exceed $200 billion by 2028, according to the International Data Corporation, further bolstering Nvidia’s growth prospects. The company’s next-generation Blackwell chips, including the recently announced Blackwell Ultra, are expected to power the next wave of AI adoption, supporting models with advanced reasoning capabilities.

Despite its dominance, Nvidia has faced challenges. U.S. trade restrictions on advanced semiconductor exports to China have impacted sales, with the company reporting a $2.5 billion revenue shortfall in the first quarter of 2025 due to these limitations. Additionally, a $4.5 billion charge was absorbed to account for further restrictions, reducing Nvidia’s sales in China from 21% of total revenue two years ago to 13% today.

Competition is also emerging, with companies like AMD and Intel developing rival AI chips, and tech firms such as Amazon and OpenAI exploring custom chip designs. Google’s use of its own tensor processing units (TPUs) poses another potential threat. Earlier this year, concerns over a low-cost Chinese AI model DeepSeek triggered a 37% drop in Nvidia’s stock from January to April, though it has since rebounded by nearly 74%.

Nvidia’s journey to $4 trillion has been remarkably swift. The company reached a $1 trillion valuation in May 2023, $2 trillion in February 2024, and $3 trillion in June 2024, outpacing all competitors. “This is a historical moment for Nvidia, the tech space flexing its muscles, and speaks to the AI Revolution hitting its next stage of growth,” said Ives, who predicts Microsoft may also cross the $4 trillion threshold this summer.

Analysts remain bullish on Nvidia’s future, with Loop Capital projecting a potential $6 trillion valuation by 2028, citing the company’s “near-monopoly” on critical AI technology. “Nvidia remains essentially a monopoly for critical tech, and it has pricing and margin power,” wrote Loop analysts Ananda Baruah and Alek Valero. Wedbush estimates that every $1 spent on Nvidia’s chips generates an $8–$10 ripple effect across the tech ecosystem.

Nvidia’s success has also elevated CEO Jensen Huang to global prominence. With a net worth of $140 billion, Huang ranks as the tenth wealthiest person worldwide, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His high-profile engagements, including meetings with President Donald Trump and international leaders, have further amplified his influence.",nvidia corporation made history today becoming first publicly traded company surpass 4 trillion market capitalization milestone reached intraday trading chipmaker’s share price surged 164 42 briefly pushing valuation beyond unprecedented threshold achievement cement nvidia’s position world’s valuable company outpacing tech giant like microsoft apple amazon google parent alphabet underscore pivotal role artificial intelligence ai revolution nvidia’s meteoric rise driven dominance ai chip market particularly graphic processing unit gpus power data centre fuelling advanced ai model cloud service company’s stock soared approximately 2 5 early trading today closing 164 32 market cap hovering 4 trillion mark staggering 1 460 increase stock value past five year year date gain nearly 22 2025 alone nvidia’s ascent 4 trillion valuation testament transformative power ai ceo jensen huang dubbed “the next industrial revolution ” originally known gpus tailored pc gaming nvidia capitalised discovery chip ideally suited complex computation required ai including large language model like chatgpt google’s gemini strategic pivot positioned nvidia backbone ai infrastructure chip high demand tech giant microsoft amazon meta alphabet well emerging ai player like openai tesla company reported 44 1 billion revenue fiscal quarter ending april 2025 69 increase period last year net income 18 78 billion 26 nvidia’s data centre business supply ai chip primary driver growth revenue surging 73 year year “there one company world foundation ai revolution nvidia ” wrote wedbush security analyst dan ives june 27 research note global spending ai infrastructure projected exceed 200 billion 2028 according international data corporation bolstering nvidia’s growth prospect company’s next generation blackwell chip including recently announced blackwell ultra expected power next wave ai adoption supporting model advanced reasoning capability despite dominance nvidia faced challenge u trade restriction advanced semiconductor export china impacted sale company reporting 2 5 billion revenue shortfall first quarter 2025 due limitation additionally 4 5 billion charge absorbed account restriction reducing nvidia’s sale china 21 total revenue two year ago 13 today competition also emerging company like amd intel developing rival ai chip tech firm amazon openai exploring custom chip design google’s use tensor processing unit tpus pose another potential threat earlier year concern low cost chinese ai model deepseek triggered 37 drop nvidia’s stock january april though since rebounded nearly 74 nvidia’s journey 4 trillion remarkably swift company reached 1 trillion valuation may 2023 2 trillion february 2024 3 trillion june 2024 outpacing competitor “this historical moment nvidia tech space flexing muscle speaks ai revolution hitting next stage growth ” said ives predicts microsoft may also cross 4 trillion threshold summer analyst remain bullish nvidia’s future loop capital projecting potential 6 trillion valuation 2028 citing company’s “near monopoly” critical ai technology “nvidia remains essentially monopoly critical tech pricing margin power ” wrote loop analyst ananda baruah alek valero wedbush estimate every 1 spent nvidia’s chip generates 8– 10 ripple effect across tech ecosystem nvidia’s success also elevated ceo jensen huang global prominence net worth 140 billion huang rank tenth wealthiest person worldwide according bloomberg billionaire index high profile engagement including meeting president donald trump international leader amplified influence

The two were prepared to ascend the stairs to the van during the I.N.D.I. Alliance’s “Bihar Bandh” protests against the special intensive revision of electoral rolls on 9th July. However, their intentions suffered a substantial setback when they were impeded by personnel designated to maintain the security of the Gandhi scion and the other leaders.

Yadav attempted move up the stairs and even received assistance before he was stopped. Other leaders were allowed to board, but Kanhaiya Kumar was also halted when it was his turn. According to reports, he was instructed to step down after he momentarily succeeded in climbing onto the vehicle.

Afterward, a disgraced Pappu Yadav was unable to hold back his tears while speaking to the media.

Initially, the leaders marched on foot, but when the throng began to grow excessively large, it was decided to continue the rally in an open van. The ruling alliance in Bihar, led by the Bharatiya Janata Party, has already attacked the opposition, asserting that the episode shows that the Congress and its senior members, including Gandhi, do not treat politicians like Kumar and Yadav properly.

“This is a fight for the Constitution, a fight for the rights of 140 crore people, a fight for the status, for minorities,” to save face and declared that the issue at hand is not about humiliation or respect, but rather about maintaining a connection with the electorate. He subsequently invoked Lord Ram, Lord Shiva and even Socrates, arguing that one must confront various challenges in life, including familial disputes and disagreements with neighbors, among others. Therefore, he added, that this incident should not be linked to notions of respect or insult, in an attempt to downplay the occurrence.

Freshly inducted Jan Suraaj leader Manish Kashyap also used the opportunity to poke fun at Yadav and Kumar. “For the first time, I genuinely feel that injustice has been done to Kanhaiya Kumar. Our ideologies are different but he is talented. He should not be treated in this manner.”

“Pappu Yadav is like a pellet drum. What can one truly say about him? He is making a forceful attempt to be a part of the Congress party, which is rejecting him. They do not extend invitations to him for any events. Why would you want to lose the little respect you have by engaging in such antics? Please refrain from this behavior,” he stated.

Kashyap further mocked, “You were elected as an independent from Purnia this time, as well as in the past. You perform commendable work during floods and other disasters. However, you are attempting to board a vehicle with your 150 kilogram weight, only to be pushed off, which is inappropriate.”

He claimed that Kanhaiya Kumar was only invited there to insult him and asked, “Did you observe Kumar’s facial expressions? He was summoned there, otherwise, he would not have attended. You invite him, have him deliver a speech, utilize his talents, and then embarrass him in front of the media and everyone else after instructing him to join other leaders on stage.

Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw shared while speaking to ET that the government plans to introduce 1,000 new trains in the next five years. One of the biggest goals is to start running the bullet train commercially by 2027.

Vaishnaw said the vision is to make Indian Railways not just more efficient and affordable for Indian passengers, but also a strong global player in train manufacturing and exports. He pointed out that India has added 35,000 km of railway tracks in the last 11 years – almost equal to Germany’s entire rail network. In just one year, 5,300 km of tracks were laid.

To support this expansion, 30,000 wagons and 1,500 locomotives are now being made every year in India – more than what North America and Europe make together. Investment in the railways has also seen a huge jump – from ₹25,000 crore earlier to ₹2.52 lakh crore now, with an extra ₹20,000 crore coming from public-private partnerships.

On the logistics front, Vaishnaw explained that transporting cargo by rail is much cheaper and more eco-friendly compared to roads. Railways currently handle 29% of all freight in India, and the aim is to increase this to 35% shortly.

Talking about the bullet train project, which is being developed with help from Japan, the minister said the prototype should be ready in 2026, and full commercial operations are expected in 2027. Institutes like IIT Madras and IIT Roorkee are helping in research and design. Many components of the high-speed rail are now being made in India and even exported abroad.

For passengers, the focus is on improving affordability and comfort. In the past two years, 2,000 general coaches have been added, and new trains like Amrit Bharat and Namo Bharat have been launched. The minister said Indian railway fares are cheaper than those in Pakistan and Bangladesh.

Safety has also improved. Derailments have dropped from 170 per year to under 30, and rail accidents are down by 80%. Vaishnaw made it clear there are no plans to privatise the Railways completely. Instead, India will follow countries like Japan and Switzerland, where railways are well-integrated and professionally managed.",indian railway gearing major transformation next year railway minister ashwini vaishnaw shared speaking et government plan introduce 1 000 new train next five year one biggest goal start running bullet train commercially 2027 vaishnaw said vision make indian railway efficient affordable indian passenger also strong global player train manufacturing export pointed india added 35 000 km railway track last 11 year – almost equal germany’s entire rail network one year 5 300 km track laid support expansion 30 000 wagon 1 500 locomotive made every year india – north america europe make together investment railway also seen huge jump – ₹25 000 crore earlier ₹2 52 lakh crore extra ₹20 000 crore coming public private partnership logistics front vaishnaw explained transporting cargo rail much cheaper eco friendly compared road railway currently handle 29 freight india aim increase 35 shortly talking bullet train project developed help japan minister said prototype ready 2026 full commercial operation expected 2027 institute like iit madras iit roorkee helping research design many component high speed rail made india even exported abroad passenger focus improving affordability comfort past two year 2 000 general coach added new train like amrit bharat namo bharat launched minister said indian railway fare cheaper pakistan bangladesh safety also improved derailment dropped 170 per year 30 rail accident 80 vaishnaw made clear plan privatise railway completely instead india follow country like japan switzerland railway well integrated professionally managed

Claims linking sudden deaths to COVID vaccine

Several claims linking sudden deaths caused by heart attack to the COVID-19 vaccine have been spreading across social media for years. However, the central government debunked all these claims earlier this month, on the grounds of two extensive studies conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research(ICMR) and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences. The studies found that there was no direct link between sudden deaths by heart attack and the COVID-19 vaccines.

Besides, studies by the ICMR and National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) affirmed that COVID-19 vaccines in India are safe and effective, with extremely rare instances of serious side effects. Sudden deaths due to heart attacks can be linked to a wide range of factors, including genetics, lifestyle, pre-existing conditions, and post-COVID complications.

To understand the causes of sudden, unexplained deaths, especially in young adults between the ages of 18 and 45 years, the ICMR and the NCDC conducted a study across 47 tertiary care hospitals in 19 states and UTs. Another study conducted by AIIMS with ICMR funding also examined cases of sudden cardiac deaths and found genetic mutations, pre-existing conditions, and lifestyle as the primary causes of these deaths and no correlation with Covid-19 vaccination.",medium portal print recently seen spreading fake news purported study conducted central government analyse pattern “to assess pattern sudden deaths” india covid 19 pandemic print published news article july 8 2025 claimed health research department dhr union ministry health collaborating inclen international clinical epidemiology network international new delhi based health research organisation conduct national community level study examine rise death among people 45 year age screenshot news article published print quoting inclen international executive director proposed lead analyst n k arora print claimed “the new nationwide assessment aim document sudden death community level across states” added “this larger study analyse trend death attempt determine risk factor mortalities” however print news article fact checked pib termed claim made fake news report theprintindia claimed centre commissioned nationwide study assess pattern sudden death india pibfactcheck ❌ claim fake ✅ nationwide survey commissioned centre department health… pic twitter com gpsrc1hz1c — pib fact check pibfactcheck july 9 2025 pib posted x “in news report theprintindia claimed centre commissioned nationwide study assess pattern sudden death india nationwide survey commissioned centre depthealthres dhr ” claim linking sudden death covid vaccine several claim linking sudden death caused heart attack covid 19 vaccine spreading across social medium year however central government debunked claim earlier month ground two extensive study conducted indian council medical research icmr india institute medical science study found direct link sudden death heart attack covid 19 vaccine besides study icmr national centre disease control ncdc affirmed covid 19 vaccine india safe effective extremely rare instance serious side effect sudden death due heart attack linked wide range factor including genetics lifestyle pre existing condition post covid complication understand cause sudden unexplained death especially young adult age 18 45 year icmr ncdc conducted study across 47 tertiary care hospital 19 state ut another study conducted aiims icmr funding also examined case sudden cardiac death found genetic mutation pre existing condition lifestyle primary cause death correlation covid 19 vaccination

Children raised without religion, caste are the hope for future: Kerala High Court Justice VG Arun



report by @GitiPratap https://t.co/8ClTnmF3um — Bar and Bench (@barandbench) July 9, 2025

Justice Arun praised parents who choose to raise their children without attaching religious or caste identities to their names. He remarked, “I laud each of you who send your children to school and teach them without linking their identities to religion or caste. These children are the promise of tomorrow. They will be the ones to ask the right questions, without fear, even in the face of societal opposition.”

His remarks echo his 2022 judgment in which he upheld the right to be recognised as non-religious in a secular country like India. The judgment came in response to a petition filed by a group of students who had passed their Class XII examinations and sought community certificates in the non-religious category for college admissions.

In the judgment, Justice Arun observed, “As has often been held, the objective of secularism is to ultimately reach a classless society. The declaration by certain citizens that they and their progeny are non-religious can only be perceived as a bold step towards that constitutional goal.”

The event was held to commemorate Pavanan, a prominent rationalist and writer known by his pen name.

It is particularly significant for the followers of Shia, the second largest branch of Islam, who commemorate and grieve the death of Imam Hussein, the grandson of the Prophet Muhammad, during the Battle of Karbala. However, like other Islamic occasions, it is often marred by violence and unrest, where Hindus are targeted, maintaining law and order turns into a challenge and communal tensions grip entire regions.

The situation has deteriorated progressively over time. This year similarly witnessed multiple incidents from different parts of the country as the weapon wielding processions attacked Hindus, their temples as well as authorities and even raised Pakistan’s flag. Such instances have become the norm nationwide where Muslim mobs create chaos and disorder under the pretext of religious processions.

The following list details multiple major incidents in which law and order was rendered ineffective as the unruly “mourners” rampaged and assaulted Hindus, cops and destroyed properties, during Muharram gatherings from 2011 to 2024.

Hindus assaulted, a youth killed and beheading threats

On the evening of 19th July 2024, some individuals began to play drums in front of a temple, during the Muharram procession in Gausganj village of Uttar Pradesh’s Bareilly which led to a dispute between the two communities. Subsequently, the disagreement escalated into a confrontation as the stone pelting ensued.

The members of Muslim community started hurling stones at Hindus and their houses from the street and harassed women. Numerous individuals sustained injuries as a result which created a tense atmosphere in the area. 26-year-old Tejpal was brutally thrashed and later died while being treated at Bareilly Medical College.

Two individuals, Alamgir and Nizakat, were taken into custody by the police, a day earlier. Alamgir was shot in the leg. A motorcycle and a pistol were found at the scene. It was disclosed that they wanted to instigate trouble during the procession. The police apprehended 35 individuals and conducted a search for those who had fled.

The administration also identified 16 structures, including a place of worship and residences of two primary perpetrators, related to this matter. The houses were demolished as a significant number of police personnel from various stations were stationed in the vicinity.

Superintendent of Police (SP) Manush Pareek infromed that two cases had been registered in relation to the occurrence. It was also revealed that the accused had unlawfully occupied land belonging to the village community and hence, the administration took it down.

Meanwhile, during the intervening night of 16th-17th July, murderous clarion calls such as “Sar Tan Se Juda” were chanted outside the residence of a Bharatiya Janata Party councillor in Kanpur. “Hindustan main rehna hoga Allahu Akbar kehna hoga” (One must say Allahu Akbar if they wish to live in India) was also heard during the Muharram procession.

Shop attacked and looted

On 17th July 2024, Shubham Kirana Store was vandalized and looted during a Muharram procession and the shopkeeper was assaulted with sticks when he protested. The incident which was recorded on CCTV camera happened in Madrasa Gali of Raja Bazar in Patna, the capital of Bihar. Afterward, a large number of cops were stationed in the area and the administration urged the public to uphold peace.

The CCTV footage showed how the shop was relentless attacked by the assailants. The refrigerator was also damaged and when the shopkeeper attempted to intervene, he was struck with a stick as well. He expressed that he had no enmity with anyone. “The attackers claimed that the Muharram procession was approaching and instructed me to close the shop. I lowered the shutter, but they came and started breaking the refrigerator.”

Nevertheless, he refuted the accusation of vandalism following his meeting with the police. His family members stated that the matter pertained to their locality and they did not wish to engage in conflict with anyone as they had to live and conduct business there. They only wished that such an incident should not repeat itself in the future and caution was exercised regarding this matter.

Bricks, stones and attack on police

Bricks and stones were thrown, resulting in numerous injuries, during the Muharram procession at the Karbala ground in Donwa village, located in the Sakra police station area of Muzaffarpur, Bihar, on 17th July 2024. The police rushed to the scene promptly after receiving reports of unrest in the wake of the disturbances during the Tazia procession.

Earlier, a police team that had arrived to confiscate a DJ in Sipahpur Bakhri neighbourhood which is under the jurisdiction of Ahiyapur police station in Muzaffarpur was also attacked. The Muslim crowd targeted the cops with stones, resulting in injuries to around 12 officers, including women. They chased the police for a kilometer, continuing to throw stones at them.

Those who could not flee were assaulted by the throng. Several police vehicles, notably the 112 unit, were subjected to attack. Somehow, the Ahiyapur police and the official automobiles managed to leave from there. The mob also blocked the road and initiated a commotion. People who were traveling through the area were also attacked and stones were thrown at the vehicles.

Over twelve vehicles, both large and small, including buses and cars, were damaged and two passengers experienced head injuries, while one person suffered a broken arm due to the stone pelting. Moreover, Palestinian flag was waved during the Tazia procession in the Mehsi police station area of Motihar after which a youth was caught by the police and was questioned after the video gained traction on social media.

Shopkeeper, his staff assaulted

On 15th July 2024 Muslim youths abused and attacked the owner of Das Music, on the main road in Ranchi following an argument over a forced Muharram donation from a store close to Sankat Mochan Mahavir Temple. The entire incident was captured on CCTV camera and it soon became viral on social media.

The victim, Rinku Das, filed a complaint at the Lower Bazaar police station, stating that two unidentified individuals arrived at his shop and inquired about a donation for Muharram. He refused to contribute and they started to abuse him. His son who was also present there tried to step in but they attacked him and their employee with a rod which wounded the two. The police then arrested the accused.

Jharkhand Bharatiya Janata Party president and former chief minister Babulal Marandi took to social media to condemn the instance and stated that these occurrences could jeopardize the peace and harmony of the entire city.

Hindu family targeted with swords, sticks

On 14th July 2024, a Hindu family inside a car was attacked with sticks and swrods by young Muslim men who took part in the Muharram procession in Dalsinghsarai of Samastipur district in Bihar. They were hurt and their vehicle was wrecked. Afterward, five persons were arrseted by the police after a FIR (First Information Report) was launched.

दलसिंहसराय में मधुबनी के रहने वाले कार में सवार एक परिवार पर ताजिया जुलूस में शामिल लोगों ने तलवार से हमला कर गाड़ी के शीशे तोड़ डाले. कार मालिक का कहना है कि उसने मौके पर @Samastipur_Pol को एवं एसपी को फोन किया पर कोई रिस्पॉन्स नही मिला. एसपी फोन नहीं उठाते ये सही है, अनुभव है pic.twitter.com/Put7hxZfbY — Bishnu K Jha | Darbhanga (@bisnujha) July 14, 2024

The procession was organized to collect soil for Tazia and participants were engaging in sword stunts while the assembly moved along the main road. During this period, Abhitesh Kumar, a resident of Madhubani district, was traversing the area on his way to Patna. His wife and son were present with him. He had parked his car along the roadside. The culprits broke the windows of his four-wheeler as well as injured him and his family.

The accused also shattered glasses of other vehicles and assaulted bike riders as well as pedestrians. The incident caused unrest as people felt scared of individuals armed with swords and sticks and vacated their vehicles to escape. The police present with the procession reportedly did not take any action and the perpetrators soon absconded.

Common people, police assaulted

On 30th July 2023, unrest broke out during the Muharram procession in the Nangloi area of Outer Delhi, leading to injuries to several policemen and pedestrians. Multiple automobile on the road, including police vehicles, were also damaged. The police indicated that the Tazia procession had more than 10,000 participants. There were attempts to divert the procession from its prescribed route and to forcibly enter the Maharaja Surajmal Stadium, which is located near the Maharaja Surajmal Stadium Metro Station.

The cops attempted to halt their movement as they lacked authorization to access the place which resulted in a confrontation and stones were thrown at the police. Several policemen and bystanders sustained wounds as well as various DTC buses and cars including those belonging to the police were hit. Some officers also incurred injuries.

According to the official complaint filed on Station House Officer Nangloi Prabhu Dayal’s statement, the organizers of the Tazia procession, who arrived on 6-7 carts, began to provoke the crowd to enter the stadium. They were armed with weapons such as swords, knives, iron rods and sticks. When the police denied entry, they retaliated by throwing stones and a member of the crowd assaulted a sub-inspector with a knife.

They also launched stones at people who were walking on the road. They destroyed the glass windows of the passing buses, frightening the passengers. Hundreds of youths were seen racing down the road as people closed their shops and left the area. Traffic was severely congested on the Nagaloi Rohtak road.

Senior police officials including Joint Commissioner of Police also arrived at the scene accompanied by a significant police presence, as cops had to resort to lathichrge to disperse the mob. A case was lodged against the accused under multiple sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

Pro-Pakistan slogans raised

During a Tazia procession on 29th July, 2023, anti-India and pro-Pakistan slogans were shouted, leading to the arrest of 33 individuals in Godhna village of Mirganj police station area in Uttar Pradesh’s Jaunpur district. The action followed the circulation of a 30-second video clip on social media, which captured Muslims chanting slogans such as Allahu Akbar, Nara-e-Takbir and Pakistan Zindabad.

The police immediately took cognizance of the video and submitted a case against 33 people under sections 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion), 153B (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national integration, if made in a place of public worship, etc), 259A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs), 188 (wilful disobedience of any order duly promulgated by a public servant empowered by law to do so) and 505(2) (hate speech) of the Indian Penal Code.

A similar instance happened in Jaunpur in 2022. A Tazia procession was held in the neighbourhood on 10th August when pro-Pakistan chants were yelled. Four people were apprehended by police after a video of the incident went viral.

Minor girl gang-raped

A 17-year-old girl who went to attend a stunt show involving sticks during Muharram was gang raped by two local boys, Mohammad Ashfaq and Mohammad Mumtaz. They abducted her and brought her to a field where they violated her sequentially. The incident occurred in a village within the jurisdiction of the Forbesganj police station in Araria of Bihar, on the night of 28th July 2023.

The perpetrators escaped the scene, leaving her in an unresponsive condition. The victim’s mother stated that she went missing during the event after which a search was carried out and she was discovered naked and unconscious in a nearby field. The culprits were nabbed and thrown behind bars after the minor girl unveiled their names.

Hindus attacked and wounded, swords brandished

On 9th August 2022, violence erupted in Kardhana, located within the jurisdiction of the Mirzamurad police station in the Varanasi district of Uttar Pradesh. Individuals transporting Tazia from Jansa village arrived at the Kardhana market via Pampapur. There was a Jamun tree along the path and the people in the procession tried to cut its branches.

However, the Hindus stopped them, but the mourners attacked them and started to throw bricks, stones and even used sticks. Witnesses indicated that swords were also brandished. Adarsh ​​Jaiswal (19), Rajan Jaiswal (25), Rahul Jaiswal (22), Khaderu Jaiswal (55), Bablu Jaiswal (56), Satya Prakash Jaiswal (29), Monu Jaiswal (30), Jamuna Jaiswal (65) and Jwala Jaiswal (60) were gravely injured.

The atmosphere in the Lohta police station area of Varanasi was equally strained. When the Tazia procession from Korauta village arrived at a person named Bhagelu Singh’s doorstep in Kotwa, the participants climed onto his door while shouting slogans which provoked a clash when people voiced their objection. Dinesh Kumar Maurya, the Kotwa outpost in-charge, swiftly reached with his police team and brought the situation under control.

On the other hand, stones were pelted at stores in Bhojipura’s Majhoua Gangapur neighbourhood in Bareilly, on the same day. The footage of the incident, which featured even women from a particular community taking part in the violence, landed on social media. According to reports, the stone-throwing lasted for almost 30 minutes before the police arrived and made an effort to defuse the situation.

The Hindu residents of Majhoua hamlet reportedly filed a complaint against the procession organisers for incorporating DJ music, which caused chaos in the vicinity. They charged that a new custom was being established thereby unsettling the social order. “If anyone tries to start a new tradition, strict action will be taken against him. Hunt is on to nab the stone pelters,” declared the authorities.

Arson, rioting and stone pelting

On 9th September 2019, chaos was witnessed at the Shajapur district headquarters in Madhya Pradesh after stones were allegedly thrown at the Muharram procession which led to a riot as arson and stone pelting commenced. Pankaj Srivastava, the Superintendent of Police for Shajapur district, mentioned that during the late-night Muharram procession, unknown assailants suddenly hurled stones at the procession on Nai Sadak Nathwada, due to which a stampede took place.

He pointed out that during the stampede, unidentified individuals initiated acts of vandalism and arson. As a result, three motorcycles were entirely consumed by fire. Later, senior police officials arrived at the scene and managed to restore order and legal proceedings were started against the anonymous accused. Cops were deployed to the area as a preventive measure.

Hindu man, two others attacked in car

On 9th September 2019, a ruckus transpired during the Muharram procession near Arya Kanya Chauraha (square) in Mutthiganj in Prayagraj of Uttar Pradesh when a car was vandalized and the individuals inside were assaulted. The protesters blocked the square, calling for the arrest of the perpetrators. Police officials, with the support of local leaders, successfully placated the situation by providing reassurance to the public.

The procession was advancing from Arya Kanya Square to Mutthiganj Square at night when the vehicle of a man named Ravi Kesarwani, son of transporter Anil Kumar, was targeted. The glass of his car was smashed and he along with Saurabh Gupta and Ravish Verma, who were accompanying him were assaulted. Ravi was seriously wounded. Once the news spread, residents of the area began to gather and demanded action against the accused. However, they returned after officers assured them.

Cops attacked, violence erupted in many areas

Multiple instances of violence came to light during the Tazia procession in the Gorakhpur district of Uttar Pradesh and its neighboring regions of Uttar Pradesh on 27th September 2018. A Taziadar was electrocuted, after which the mob not only assaulted police officers but also set a police vehicle ablaze. A sub-inspector was left battered and covered in blood, in Bhathat. They also damaged other cars on the road.

This incident occurred in Pipraich, close to Gorakhpur. A young man, who was seated on a DJ vehicle during the Tazia procession, died after he came into contact with the electric wire from the Doordarshan Center in Bhathat. Afterward, the crowed stormed the police station and assaulted a sub-inspector and a home guard who sustained serious injuries. They also vandalized the sub-inspector’s vehicle.

Moreover, another case of unrest in Gorakhpur emerged near Tarang crossing where angered people blocked the road after a youth was attacked with a weapon during a dispute over the movement of the Tazia. Police arrested one person in relation to the issue.

There have been reports of violent incidents in the nearby areas in addition to Gorakhpur. There was one instance in Kushinagar where a dispute over the route of the Tazia procession led to violence, injuring numerous people. At the same time, disagreements over the procession’s route caused Tazias to be obstructed at several locations in Maharajganj, which led to reports of unrest in the area.

Violence was also reported in Deoria. A young person was hurt in the the procession and apparently did not receive adequate medical attention after which the agitated mob damaged Rampur Chauraha, in the district’s Gauri Bazaar. Many automobiles, including an ambulance and police cars, were wrecked by the crowd.

Arson, vandalism and communal tension

On 2nd October 2017 communal tension spread concerning the movement of the Tazia without an established route, in Parampurwa located in the jurisdiction of the Juhi police station in Kanpur district of Uttar Pradesh. It resulted in stone pelting between two groups.

“The Muharram procession in Parampurva was to be taken out through a certain path but it was suddenly changed which led to a dispute between the two parties. The police force present on the spot managed the situation. But some unruly elements started setting fire to vehicles parked on the roadside. After that, stone pelting started,” highlighted Additional Director General of Police Avinash Chandra.

Law enforcement officials, including senior personnel, were deployed to uphold law and order and to take stock of the violence. The district and police administration requested that citizens stay indoors, owing to the critical situation.

Meanwhile, on the same day, violence was unleashed in Gujarat’s Vadodara during the immersion procession of Tazia, resulting in stone-throwing and three injuries. They wounded were taken to a private hospital. Police had to fire four tear gas shells and three rounds to bring the situation under control.

Violence led to imposition of curfew

On 1st October 2017, several individuals were injured during a Muharram procession in the Jamui district of Bihar after which a curfew was slapped in the area. A considerable number of police personnel were deployed. Superintendent of Police Jayant Kant informed that a minor argument between two groups transpired at Masaurhi Chowk, reported Aaj Tak. Afterwards, members of a specific community took part in arson during the Tazia procession, which resulted in violence and many persons were wounded, including police personnel.

Stone pelting and curfew

On 24th August 2015 curfew was imposed after stone pelting was reported in a locality over a dispute about the procession route.

Shops damaged, houses set on fire

On 5th November 2014, unrest transpired in various districts of Awadh in Uttar Pradesh during the Muharram procession. The crowd engaged in vandalism, damaged shops and torched them. Additionally, multiple instances of gunfire were reported. During the Tazia procession in the Bahraich district, a chaat cart was looted in Parampur of Rupaidiha as a dispute took place. Additionally, a hut was set ablaze and a flour mill was damaged.

The authorities managed to restore order after considerable effort. Likewise, disturbances were reported from Baundi and Payagpur. Another conflict started over climbing onto the platform of a religious place duirng Muharram procession in Mathura Bazar of Balrampur district. Afterward, numerous shops were set on fire and gubshots were heard.

The market remained quiet the following day as well. Police filed a case against several individuals and arrested four. Tensions ran high in Anbhula village of Rasulabad in Musafirkhana, Amethi district when a peg that was in the way of the procession was removed and a house’s thatched roof was put on fire by the participants.

Violence and assault on police personnel

Several individuals were wounded on 5th November 2014, as the Muharram procession in Rajasthan’s Bhilwara descended into violence. Jyoti Swaroop Sharma, an additional superintendent of police, was hurt when the Muslim residents of the old city threw stones at the cops. The crowd was then dispersed by the police using batons. 50 unnamed individuals were booked for rioting and stone-throwing and two were arrested.

A traffic bottleneck also resulted from the brief halt of the Muharram procession near Old Kuthcery Road. Sharma was struck in one eye by a stone that was thrown at him after police ordered the mourners to leave. Two young people were then apprehended for interrogation at the Bhimganj police station after the cops used lathi-charge.

This infuriated the crowd even further and the protesters demanded the their release, pausing the procession for about an hour. The procession was able to continue after the police intervened, but the mourners once more stopped at Tejaji Ka Chowk. After some time, the Muslim mob gathered at the same location and the police had to use force.

Muslim mob instigates terror against Hindus

On 15th November 2012, violence erupted in a bustling market located in the Bhadohi Kotwali area of Uttar Pradesh during the Muharram procession, resulting in a devastating situation in the city. Muslim mobs unleashed chaos in predominantly Hindu neighborhoods.

Additional Superintendent of Police, Shubham Agarwal, reported that 50-year-old Shamim Ansari, son of Hafiz Ansari, along with several associates, unleahsed terror on the area. They blocked the road, did vandalism, arson and threw stones at houses and trains.

Several sections of Indian Penal Code were slapped on him alongside 152 Railway Act, 4/5 Explosive Substances Act and 7 Criminal Law (Amendment) Act at Bhadohi police station. He was arrested last month following a tip-off from an informant.

Cops targeted, Hindus attacked

A disagreement began on 8th December 2011, when Muslims attempted to take out the Muharram procession by a different route from Malokhar village in the Dulhipur region under the jurisdiction of the Mughalsarai police station in the Chandauli district of Uttar Pradesh. However, members of the other community objected to the start of a new practice which enraged the mob which went on a frenzy and engaged in mayhem, claiming that Tazia was damaged.

A car, many motorcycles, a pumping set, hutments, fodder and mounds of upla (cawdung cakes used as fuel) were set on fire by them. The cops had to use force to break up the rowdy mob. However, the irate crowd started brick-batting, injuring many police officers, members of the media and even residents.

Two of the five seriously wounded police officers were transferred to Varanasi after they were taken to Chandauli District Hospital. 200 people from roughly 25 families were impacted by the violence. Section 144 was imposed on the area.

“After lodging of FIR (First Information Report) against 43 identified persons and over 400 unidentified persons for indulging in violence and arson and interrupting the government work, efforts for their arrest have been intensified. Video clippings are also being utilised to identify the demonstrators. The policemen suffered injuries during violence are out of danger,” stated Superintendent of Police, Chandauli, Shalabh Mathu while talking to The Times of India.

Conclusion

The aforementioned cases represent merely the tip of the iceberg, as Muslim mobs have historically, whether in the name of mourning or celebration, consistently exploited such events to attack Hindus and display their street power in the most reprehensible ways. They provoke with the most offensive slogans, brandish weapons, embark on a rampage and make a complete mockery of law and order. At the same time, the authorities and administration have also largely failed to control them or prevent such incidents.",muharram viewed one revered month islam second ramzan particularly significant

OpIndia,09/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/bihar-bandh-cripples-eci-operations-how-the-opposition-is-undermining-a-legal-electoral-exercise-to-stoke-unrest/,Bihar Bandh cripples ECI operations: How the opposition is undermining a legal electoral exercise to stoke unrest,"As the Bihar state assembly election approaches, the opposition has once again resorted to questionable practices. False allegations aimed at disrupting the functioning of the Election Commission of India (ECI) have once again gained nationwide attention. Opposition parties, including Lalu Yadav’s Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and other Mahagathbandhan allies such as the Congress, Left parties, Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP), and independent leader Pappu Yadav, have taken to the streets in Bihar to protest against the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) being conducted in the state ahead of the assembly elections.

Rahul Gandhi, the Leader of the Opposition, and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav are expected to join hands and lead a statewide protest in Bihar on July 9. Rahul Gandhi will participate in the protest march starting at 10 a.m. in Patna, from the Income Tax office at Golambar to the Election Commission office. The protest will be directed against the central poll body’s decision to revise electoral rolls and implement the new labour code.

Roads are being blocked with burning tyres by local leaders in areas like Sonpur and Hajipur. In Jehanabad, the student wing of the RJD has even blocked railway tracks. In Hajipur, RJD supporters have blocked the Gandhi Setu, while in Sonpur, RJD MLA Mukesh Roshan has led the blockade. Meanwhile, members of the RJD’s student wing have blocked train tracks at Jehanabad railway station.

The road blockade, or “chakka jam,” comes just ahead of the Bihar assembly elections. Interestingly, it coincides with the “Bharat Bandh,” a protest demanding minimum wage, a new labour code, and addressing several other issues.

Before we delve into why the opposition is engaging in such protests, it is important to understand why the Centre has initiated the Special Intensive Revision.

What is the Special Intensive Revision?

To conduct free and fair elections, enhance transparency, and eliminate ineligible entries from the voter list, the Election Commission has decided to initiate a Special Intensive Revision (SIR) in Bihar ahead of the assembly elections. The SIR is being implemented as an urgent corrective measure to rectify the electoral rolls.

Launched on June 24, the initiative seeks to include the names of eligible citizens in the voter list while removing those who are no longer eligible. According to the ECI, multiple factors such as rapid urbanisation, the influx of illegal immigrants, inclusion of newly eligible young citizens, unreported deaths, and the presence of names of foreign nationals make this revision critically important.

Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar has said, “Not a single political party is satisfied with the current status of electoral rolls for different reasons. During the past four months, all 4,123 Electoral Registration Officers (EROs), 775 District Election Officers (DEOs), and 36 Chief Electoral Officers (CEOs) have conducted nearly 5,000 meetings with 28,000 political party representatives. The ECI has also invited all recognised political parties for interaction. No one was satisfied with the current status of the electoral rolls for one reason or another.”

How will the process function?



To ensure smooth and hassle-free execution of the electoral process, the Election Commission has developed a detailed plan. As per the EC, the Electoral Registration Officers will provide enumeration forms to Booth-Level Officers (BLOs). These BLOs will then distribute the forms to voters via door to door visits. Voters will have the option to upload supporting documents online. Once submitted, the forms will be verified, and a preliminary electoral roll will be published on the websites of both the ECI and the respective Chief Electoral Officers. This draft will also be shared with political parties. Voters and political parties will be allowed to raise objections to the draft list. Once all objections have been reviewed and addressed, the final electoral roll will be released.

The Election Commission aims to publish the draft electoral roll on August 1 and the final list by September 30. As of now, nearly 87 per cent (6.86 crore) of Bihar’s 7.90 crore voters have received enumeration forms during the ongoing Special Intensive Revision, according to the ECI. The Commission also noted that 1.5 crore households have already been covered in the first round of visits by BLOs.

The Election Commission has made it mandatory for voters to submit at least one of 11 listed documents for verification. These include:

Birth certificates

Passports

Identity cards or pension payment orders issued to government employees or pensioners

Permanent residence certificates

Forest right certificates

Caste certificates

Family registers prepared by state or local authorities

Land or house allotment certificates issued by the government

Aadhaar is not included in the list of acceptable documents for verification.

Why are they protesting a legal electoral process?

The opposition has raised concerns about the process, claiming it may lead to the exclusion of legitimate voters through the misuse of government machinery. The Congress backed Empowered Action Group of Leaders and Experts (EAGLE) criticized the Election Commission’s move, suggesting that the revision of electoral rolls could end up causing more harm than the issue it intends to address.

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee also condemned the process, accusing the Election Commission of targeting the youth in Bengal under the guise of verifying voter lists. She pointed out that a new declaration form requires those born between July 1, 1987, and December 2, 2004, to submit their parents’ birth certificates to get enrolled—questioning the necessity and fairness of such a requirement. “What is happening in the name of full enumeration?” she asked, calling the directive irregular and troubling.

Tejashwi Yadav echoed similar sentiments, arguing that the Election Commission’s decision would ultimately disenfranchise poor and marginalised individuals who rely solely on Aadhaar as identification, an ID that the EC now deems unacceptable for verification.

In addition, a group of 11 parties from the INDIA bloc submitted a formal objection to senior Election Commission officials, labelling the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) as a serious threat to the foundational principles of the Constitution.

While the Election Commission maintains that the revision aims to enhance accuracy and transparency in the electoral process, opposition parties appear focused on undermining the initiative without offering concrete alternatives. Their increasingly aggressive demonstrations have begun to obstruct a lawful and necessary democratic procedure.

Rather than engaging constructively to strengthen the electoral process, the opposition appears more focused on inciting chaos for political gain. With Bihar heading into a crucial election, the priority should be safeguarding a fair, transparent, and inclusive voter roll, not turning voter verification into a battleground for partisan theatrics.",bihar state assembly election approach opposition resorted questionable practice false allegation aimed disrupting functioning election commission india eci gained nationwide attention

In a recent report published on Tuesday, 8th July, FATF cited instances such as the 2019 Pulwama attack and the 2022 Gorakhnath Temple attack in India to bring attention to this increasing danger.

The report, Comprehensive Update on Terrorist Financing Risks, reveals terrorists’ persistent ability to exploit the international financial system to support their activities and carry out attacks.

Pulwama Attack Used Online Platforms for Explosives, Says FATF

As per FATF’s findings, key materials used in the 2019 Pulwama attack were bought through an e-commerce platform. The report says that aluminium powder, which was used to make the explosive more powerful, was purchased via Amazon.

On 14th February, 2019, a suicide bombing targeted a convoy of Indian Security forces in Pulwama in Jammu & Kashmir, resulting in the deaths of 40 soldiers. India’s authorities concluded that the attack was orchestrated by Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), a Pakistan-based terror group. The suicide bomber was identified as Adil Ahmad Dar. After the investigation, 19 people, including seven foreign nationals, were charged under India’s anti-terror laws

FATF said the materials were part of an improvised explosive device (IED) that caused the deadly blast. FATF mentioned that in such cases, terrorists are using platforms like Amazon to quietly buy equipment and chemicals. These platforms also help them move money in ways that are difficult to track.

Lone-wolf attacker in Gorakhnath temple case used PayPal and VPN: FATF

The FATF report also discusses the 2022 Gorakhnath Temple incident in Uttar Pradesh.

On April 3, a man identified as Ahmad Murtaza Abbasi initiated an attack on Gorakhnath Temple in Uttar Pradesh. The incident took place just a day before UP CM Yogi Adityanath was scheduled to visit the temple. Abbasi’s family claimed he was mentally unstable, but the claims were refuted by the Police and doctors who treated him after the attack.

According to FATF, the attacker, who was influenced by ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria) ideology, used online payment services like PayPal to send nearly ₹6.7 lakh (around $7,685) abroad in support of the terror group.

The person also received money from a foreign source and used a VPN to hide his identity online. The report says he made 44 international transactions through PayPal and even paid for VPN services through his bank account.

Due to these suspicious activities, PayPal suspended his account to stop further misuse. FATF said that such use of digital payment platforms gives terrorists new ways to transfer money and stay hidden.

State support for Terrorism still a big problem

The FATF didn’t just stop at online platforms. It also raised concerns over the role of national governments in supporting terrorist groups. According to the report, some terrorist organisations continue to receive financial help, training, and logistical support from certain governments.

Though the report doesn’t directly name countries, India has often accused Pakistan of backing terrorist organisations like JeM. Indian officials have long maintained that Pakistan shelters designated terrorists and misuse international funds to aid terror activities.

As per FATF, this kind of state support is often used not only for funding attacks but also for long-term management of terror operations.

How terrorists use online shopping and payments

According to FATF, terrorists have found multiple ways to misuse e-commerce platforms, also known as Electronic and Physical Online Marketplaces (EPOMs).

These platforms are being used not just to purchase materials like chemicals, weapons, and other equipment, but also to sell items and generate funds for terrorist activities. Some even use fake transactions to disguise the movement of money, a method similar to trade-based money laundering.

FATF noted that platforms which offer easy access across borders and allow anonymous or pseudonymous payments are particularly at risk. Such digital tools have become preferred channels for not only organised terror groups but also lone actors and extremist groups motivated by ethnic or racial ideologies to fund their operations and spread propaganda.

Terror groups getting smarter with technology

FATF said that with the rise of fintech companies and peer-to-peer (P2P) payment apps, terrorists now have more ways to move money secretly. These services tend to permit the use of fictitious identities or pseudonyms, which complicate it for investigators to identify the origins of the funds.

FATF added that groups are even utilising social media to collect funds in the form of donations and crowdfunding, bringing recruitment, propaganda, and financing all together in one location.

What FATF wants the government to do

FATF has urged its 200 member jurisdictions to enhance monitoring of virtual financial services and better regulate online platforms.

The organisation advises monitoring suspicious activity on web-based e-commerce sites, tightening controls on peer-to-peer payment services, and collaborating closely with international platforms such as PayPal and Amazon to identify and prevent abuse.

FATF wrapped up by cautioning that while terrorists keep embracing sophisticated digital practices, it is only through robust international collaboration that they would be stopped from misusing online platforms to fund terrorism.",financial action task force fatf international watchdog track terror funding identified serious concern regarding use e commerce site online payment facility terrorist execute finance attack recent report published tuesday 8th july fatf cited instance 2019 pulwama attack 2022 gorakhnath temple attack india bring attention increasing danger report comprehensive update terrorist financing risk reveals terrorists’ persistent ability exploit international financial system support activity carry attack pulwama attack used online platform explosive say fatf per fatf’s finding key material used 2019 pulwama attack bought e commerce platform report say aluminium powder used make explosive powerful purchased via amazon 14th february 2019 suicide bombing targeted convoy indian security force pulwama jammu kashmir resulting death 40 soldier india’s authority concluded attack orchestrated jaish e mohammed jem pakistan based terror group suicide bomber identified adil ahmad dar investigation 19 people including seven foreign national charged india’s anti terror law fatf said material part improvised explosive device ied caused deadly blast fatf mentioned case terrorist using platform like amazon quietly buy equipment chemical platform also help move money way difficult track lone wolf attacker gorakhnath temple case used paypal vpn fatf fatf report also discusses 2022 gorakhnath temple incident uttar pradesh april 3 man identified ahmad murtaza abbasi initiated attack gorakhnath temple uttar pradesh incident took place day cm yogi adityanath scheduled visit temple abbasi’s family claimed mentally unstable claim refuted police doctor treated attack according fatf attacker influenced isi islamic state iraq syria ideology used online payment service like paypal send nearly ₹6 7 lakh around 7 685 abroad support terror group person also received money foreign source used vpn hide identity online report say made 44 international transaction paypal even paid vpn service bank account due suspicious activity paypal suspended account stop misuse fatf said use digital payment platform give terrorist new way transfer money stay hidden state support terrorism still big problem fatf didn’t stop online platform also raised concern role national government supporting terrorist group according report terrorist organisation continue receive financial help training logistical support certain government though report doesn’t directly name country india often accused pakistan backing terrorist organisation like jem indian official long maintained pakistan shelter designated terrorist misuse international fund aid terror activity per fatf kind state support often used funding attack also long term management terror operation terrorist use online shopping payment according fatf terrorist found multiple way misuse e commerce platform also known electronic physical online marketplace epoms platform used purchase material like chemical weapon equipment also sell item generate fund terrorist activity even use fake transaction disguise movement money method similar trade based money laundering fatf noted platform offer easy access across border allow anonymous pseudonymous payment particularly risk digital tool become preferred channel organised terror group also lone actor extremist group motivated ethnic racial ideology fund operation spread propaganda terror group getting smarter technology fatf said rise fintech company peer peer p2p payment apps terrorist way move money secretly service tend permit use fictitious identity pseudonym complicate investigator identify origin fund fatf added group even utilising social medium collect fund form donation crowdfunding bringing recruitment propaganda financing together one location fatf want government fatf urged 200 member jurisdiction enhance monitoring virtual financial service better regulate online platform organisation advises monitoring suspicious activity web based e commerce site tightening control peer peer payment service collaborating closely international platform paypal amazon identify prevent abuse fatf wrapped cautioning terrorist keep embracing sophisticated digital practice robust international collaboration would stopped misusing online platform fund terrorism
OpIndia,09/07/25,,https://www.opindia.com/2025/07/how-a-30-kg-ai-powered-x-guard-system-fooled-pakistani-army-into-thinking-they-were-hitting-a-rafale/,"How a 30-kg, AI-powered, X-Guard system fooled Pakistani army into thinking they were hitting a Rafale","Months have passed since India conducted Operation Sindoor to attack Pakistani terror and military establishments, yet stories of the tactics and ingenuity of the Indian Armed Forces continue to intrigue the world. It has now been reported that the Indian Air Force used the artificial intelligence-powered towed decoy system X-Guard on Indian Rafales during the four-day military conflict in May 2025.

A former F-16 pilot Ryan Bodenheimer, called Operation Sindoor, a breakthrough in modern aerial combat. Developed by Rafale Advanced Defense Systems, X-Guard creates a 500-watt, 360-degree jamming signal using artificial intelligence. The 30-kilogram device follows the aircraft along a fibre-optic wire that is 100 meters long. It makes it harder for adversary radar systems and missiles to spot genuine aircraft by simulating the radar emissions and Doppler effect of an authentic Rafale fighter.

Bodenheimer dubbed the X-Guard “the best spoofing and deception we’ve ever seen.” The former F-16 pilot added that the decoy system may have “redefined the rules of electronic warfare.”

As per the IDRW report, Pakistan’s Chinese-made PL-15E air-to-air missiles and J-10C fighter jets failed to detect or target the actual Indian fighter jets. The decoy misled missile systems and confounded enemy radar. An export variant of China’s PL-15, the PL-15E missile, lacked sophisticated spoofing resistance. It’s also possible that the X-Guard tricked Pakistan’s J-10C fighters’ KLJ-7A AESA radar into believing they had locked onto and struck Rafale jets.

Apparently, Pakistani ‘Aand’ Forces counted the decoys they struck as Rafale hits and came up with claims of shooting down 4 to 5 Indian fighter jets. However, when asked for proof, even their defence minister would say “It’s all over the social media.”

Other than X-Guard, the Indian decoy drones also played a vital role, especially in creating heat signatures that matched Indian fighter jets, confusing the Pakistani air defence system.",month passed since india conducted operation sindoor attack pakistani terror military establishment yet story tactic ingenuity indian armed force continue intrigue world reported indian air force used artificial intelligence powered towed decoy system x guard indian rafales four day military conflict may 2025 former f 16 pilot ryan bodenheimer called operation sindoor breakthrough modern aerial combat developed rafale advanced defense system x guard creates 500 watt 360 degree jamming signal using artificial intelligence 30 kilogram device follows aircraft along fibre optic wire 100 meter long make harder adversary radar system missile spot genuine aircraft simulating radar emission doppler effect authentic rafale fighter bodenheimer dubbed x guard “the best spoofing deception we’ve ever seen ” former f 16 pilot added decoy system may “redefined rule electronic warfare ” per idrw report pakistan’s chinese made pl 15e air air missile j 10c fighter jet failed detect target actual indian fighter jet decoy misled missile system confounded enemy radar export variant china’s pl 15 pl 15e missile lacked sophisticated spoofing resistance it’s also possible x guard tricked pakistan’s j 10c fighters’ klj 7a aesa radar believing locked onto struck rafale jet apparently pakistani ‘aand’ force counted decoy struck rafale hit came claim shooting 4 5 indian fighter jet however asked proof even defence minister would say “it’s social medium ” x guard indian decoy drone also played vital role especially creating heat signature matched indian fighter jet confusing pakistani air defence system
